  "title": "Are eighteen-year-olds mature enough to vote?",
  "answer": "There are several arguments against eighteen-year-olds voting, most of which relate to the relative ignorance of youth. \\u2028First, most young people are not interested in politics. I’m sure everyone can find some thoughtful eighteen-year-olds who ought to vote, but if you go to any college campus and talk to the first thousand freshmen you meet, you’ll find five who are qualified to vote and eight hundred who don’t know who Churchill was.\\u2028Second, younger people are relatively inexperienced and therefore seldom possess the virtue of wisdom. People's votes will influence the direction of government in a certain way, but many young people don’t know what they’re voting for because they don't really know much about the issues facing society. They just listen to the propaganda coming from party political ads and vote based on what has the biggest emotional impact. In spite of this, I support the assertion that eighteen-year-olds should have the right to vote. I believe this for several reasons. First, some people might question the ability of young voters to cast a meaningful vote, but if these young citizens are old enough to drive, work without restrictions on their hours, and pay taxes, why shouldn’t they also have a voice in their local government? If they are not granted the right to vote, they are experiencing taxation without representation. Second, young people today are far better intellectually, physically, and emotionally equipped to partake in democratic procedures than past generations were. The young adult of today, for example, possesses unparalleled opportunities for education at high school level, which will enable them to think more profoundly and develop an informed political standpoint.

  "title": "What do you consider the rudest way to behave?",
  "answer": "Cutting in line is one of the rudest offenses a person can commit. \\u2028Standing in line is a great example of a deep-seated cultural etiquette. We stand in line at grocery stores, banks, government offices and fast food restaurants. Even in preschool we're taught to line up. If a four-year-old can do it, why can’t you? Failure to observe line protocol is swiftly punished by authority figures and by social condemnation. \\u2028Second, to cut in line is to grant yourself a privilege above everyone else for no good reason. It inconveniences multiple other people in order to convenience you. If everyone else joined you in abandoning the system, then we'd have anarchy. If no one else joined you, then all of the people who've been waiting patiently in line have been punished by your refusal to wait. This is clearly unfair. ",
