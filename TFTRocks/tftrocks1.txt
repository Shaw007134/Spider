  "answer": "Over the past few years, more and more families have been making the intentional effort to have regular family meal times.  Firstly, this is because it's bonding time. Families who eat dinner together regularly are more likely to have stronger, happier family relationships. As families struggle to spend quality time together, family dinnertimes provide the opportunity for both. When families hang out together and communicate, they grow strong and healthy.  Secondly, it's a chance to resolve conflicts. A regular family dinnertime provides natural opportunities for planning and problem solving. Scheduling family meeting times to discuss plans, needs and problem solving can be difficult. A regular family mealtime can offer a natural solution to the challenge.",

Also, if he gets married and has a child, the already challenging responsibility of parenthood becomes more difficult.

Then – by means of movements, lines, colors, sounds, or forms expressed in words – they convey that feeling so others may vicariously experience it. It is amazing how the arts can unite people across the globe, no matter where they are from. Art transcends cultural differences and strives to capture what it means to be human.If humanity was without art, people might be almost more savage and, above all, more isolated from, and more hostile to, one another. What are the differences between humans and beasts? A life without art is a life in a black and white, one bereft of color. ",

  "answer": "I prefer to read novels because I enjoy them the most. Novels can teach you a lot about how people used to live and what society was like in the past. Novels like _Hard Times_ by Charles Dickens reminds us of the poverty in London during the Industrial Revolution, whilst Jane Austen’s fiction shows us what family life was like in the 18th century. People who are interested in history or philosophy can read novels to find out how ideas have changed and how the world became what it is today.Novels are usually brimming with memorable stories and interesting characters. One of my favorite books is Charles Dickens’ _Great Expectations_. It is about a boy called Pip who suddenly receives a lot of money from a mysterious patron. As he grows up, his character changes, and he becomes quite selfish and mean. Another important character in the book is an old woman called Miss Havisham. When she was young, her fiancé ran away on their wedding day. She lives in a dark house and still wears her wedding dress. She is a fascinating character, both sad and scary. I think that novels can be very satisfying, but sometimes I feel like reading something lighter. In my opinion, it’s important to read lots of different kinds of novels, if possible in another language.",

This selfishness then, in turn, frequently leads to serious stress for parents, siblings, peers, schools and communities. Unfortunately, selfishness is seldom considered one of the possible causes of intense anger and defiant behavior in this age group. Because of this, children can be misdiagnosed as ADHD because of their impulsivity. This often occurs when they do not get their own way or are starved of the attention they so crave.

Due to this, it becomes easier to share problems and feelings with them. An old friend knows and understands you more intimately than a new friend. When you are seeking comfort from those around you, an old friend can immediately offer you what you want with confidence, because they know you better.Moreover, old friends know your strengths and weaknesses so they can offer more effective guidance. New friendships take time to develop, as each person is not completely aware of the other’s likes and dislikes. With old friends, this stage has already been passed and they know how you will behave in a particular situation, often before the situation has arisen. Hence, an old friend can offer a clear picture of what is good and bad for you. Therefore, I tend to give old friends priority.",

Simply put, without these efforts there would be fewer species alive today, and the world’s ecosystems would be poorer for it.What’s more, a good zoo can be very educational. People in cities will never see a wild animal beyond a fox or pigeon, let alone a lion or giraffe. Sure, television nature documentaries get ever more detailed and impressive every year, but they still pale in comparison to seeing a living creature in the flesh, hearing it, smelling it and having the time to absorb details.

  "answer": "Giving practical gifts can be less troublesome and more memorable. One never really knows what the receiver wants to receive. So why not choose something from the list of daily necessities as a gift? Through doing this, you not only limit the time taken choosing a gift, but can also be sure the gift is useful to the receiver. Moreover, practical gifts are more valuable because the receiver is likely to use them frequently. Consider the sports shoes I once gave to my boyfriend. Every time he picks them up, he will be reminded of my deep affection for him. For the duration of the gift’s lifespan, our relationship will be improved.",

Fables and parables are designed to communicate important values and lessons. Secondly, I feel that imaginative literature is more beneficial than its nonfictional counterpart, as it offers insight into other people's thoughts and behavior in different situations, thus widening the scope of experiences we can envisage.",

I use it to keep track of hundreds of academic books I need to read for qualifying exams, to take detailed, organized notes on research and to keep track of writing and ideas.

First, I create a new notebook in Evernote with the title of the trip. Then I just add all travel info into the Evernote notebook.

  "answer": "I have to say that an outdoor camping night is the best activity, as it would help students enhance their personal relationships and make friends. \\u2028An outdoor camping night teaches students to be cooperative and united. Sometimes camping and its associated activities present students with challenges. Often these are challenges that they don’t deal with on a daily basis – where and how to set up a tent, or how to deal with scenarios when they aren’t armed with all their modern conveniences and items of familiarity. Only with help and collective efforts can they overcome such challenges.\\u2028Also, an outdoor camping night shortens the emotional distance between the students. During a camping trip, students live in small groups where they have to work together and rely on each other. Typical camping activities like cooking together, hiking and sitting around the campfire chatting until late into the night build and improve friendships. In a nutshell, an outdoor camping night will perform a significant role in promoting relationships between students.",

For example, wind speeds of over fifteen kilometers per hour may be detrimental to fishing or water skiing, whereas motor boating may be undertaken at wind speeds of up to fifty kilometers per hour. Also, weather will influence how enjoyable an experience is, and, therefore, tourists’ satisfaction is likely to be at least partly weather dependent.

  "answer": "The first noteworthy point regarding the issue is that the main purpose of evaluation – which is to illustrate the positive and negative points of the class and the professor – is crucial in the betterment process. But, perhaps, the more concrete advantage is that it will lead students to believe that they are a part of this process, that their opinion may incite change. In this way, they will be more self-confident. Furthermore, the professor will likely keep student satisfaction at the forefront of their mind throughout the semester. \\u2028Conversely, a possible disadvantage is that the evaluation questions are largely typical and old-fashioned. As a result, students tend not to provide a lot of information, which stifles change. Furthermore, the students may be bored by the process of answering such questions. As a personal example, in our university we have to evaluate our professors at the end of the semester in our portal university site. There are a bunch of questions regarding the professor and the course, but they are the same for both theoretical and experimental classes.

  "answer": "I support the assertion that the government should build a park because good facilities contribute to the general quality of life in the community. A community with good parks and other facilities is a more pleasant and sociable place to live, with a lively outdoor and cultural life. Residents spend more time in the community, and therefore are more familiar with one another. This contributes to an amplified sense of community.What's more, good parks can make the community more attractive, physically. Well-designed parks, especially when they're part of a comprehensive community plan, can add greatly to the pleasant atmosphere of a community. Parks can include flowerbeds, grassy lawns, benches, playgrounds, picnic areas, and sports fields, as in Central Park in New York or Golden Gate Park in San Francisco. Parks are the lungs of a city, offering green space and fresh air to people who otherwise may seldom experience anything but concrete and exhaust fumes.Notes：sociable place：友善的，好社交的 grassy lawns：茵茵草坪 otherwise：否则…… ，一般与might／would等词合用表示如果不然，就会如何如何，是常用的写作句式 concrete and exhaust fumes：混凝土和废气，与绿色对比，代表了社区里不健康的元素",

  "answer": "I think that hard work is more important to a musician or artist than the possession of innate talent. In reality, talent can only carry you so far, the rest is hard work. Perceptions of someone’s natural talent are often skewed. When we see a fine piece of art or music, for example, we often conclude that the artist must be really gifted. We come to this conclusion because we’re judging the end result – the artwork itself. We tend to forget about the process and the journey of getting there; the artist may have been practicing for many years to get to that point. In which case, hard work plays a huge role, regardless of whether he/she is naturally gifted or not. I believe that with sufficient determination and effort pretty much everyone can be an artist or a musician, even a professional one. A good artist? That's another matter. But many famous artists weren't all that good, depending on what criteria you want to judge them by.",

  "answer": "I agree. Today, many companies are investing heavily in advertising and grabbing the customer's attention. Hence, the effect advertising has on what people buy is undeniable.\\u2028One of the primary reasons for this is that advertising provides an atmosphere within which people can become familiar with a new product. It is obvious that no-one ever buys a product they are unaware of. Advertising is the bridge between company and customer. Once aware of a product, the customer thinks about it and consequently feels a need to own/consume it. \\u2028Additionally, advertising has the potential to change the public’s perspective and beliefs. Many psychologists have explained that when an audience watches an advertisement over and over, after a while he or she accepts the product. This may happen even when the person did not initially hold the product in high regard. This is the the best evidence of the power of advertising. ",

  "answer": "Being a student is about developing an independent mind. Challenging others, even professors, is therefore acceptable.\\u2028It is terrible when everyone agrees with authority. When this happens, nobody builds upon their teachings. Consider when, in the Middle Ages, most people accepted Aristotle’s geocentric theory. If no one dared to challenge or doubt it, little advancements would have occurred in fields like math, science and technology. A great teacher not only transfers to their students existing knowledge and perspectives, but simultaneously provides opportunities and motivation to explore their own theories and research.\\u2028Instructors may belong to a totally different era to their students, and answers to a problem are best resolved when approached from different angles. To quote Voltaire, “I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.” Students have the right to express their views as their instructors’ equal. There are more insights to be gained in the discussion this way. One plus one is greater than two. ",

  "answer": "An emerging, highly flexible economic network known as the sharing economy allows people to share personal resources with one another, often at significantly lower cost than traditional methods. Sounds good huh? There are, however, still a lot of shortcomings associated with the system. It has a long way to go. \\u2028The primary issue is that this model has privacy and safety concerns. The sharing economy requires people on both sides of the transaction to forfeit some privacy. For instance, when you rent out your house on Airbnb, you basically invite strangers into your home. While you trust your renters to be respectful and law abiding, you can’t be 100% sure that they’ll follow through.\\u2028Moreover, the system lacks certainty. When you share your resources with others – whether by renting out a house, car, or equipment; or by participating in a talent marketplace – you also assume the risk that you won’t get paid or that the items you share will be damaged. For instance, in a talent marketplace, there’s typically a finite number of jobs for which you’re qualified, and thus no guarantee of a steady income – or even payment for completed work if the buyer isn’t satisfied.\\u2028In conclusion, the sharing economy still has a long path to traverse. The only certainty is that the sharing economy must play a lead role in the coming future.",

When asked a question about an item on the menu, a detailed answer from the waiter reassures the customer.

  "answer": "Personally, I agree with the idea that talking with other people is definitely the key to success in college. Conversation is an excellent way to express yourself. In a classroom where students speak to each other about mathematics, for instance, the ideas of these students are valued instead of ignored or potentially marginalized. This gives students agency in their learning.Moreover, it also helps students form a practical perspective. We all know that in order to completely understand the language we know, we have to use it, either in writing or ideally in conversation. This rule applies in almost any university course. Students need to talk in order to develop their use of the knowledge, and check out whether they truly understand concepts. This is surely better than just keeping silent and listening.\\u2028Finally, in conversation, thoughts are integrated. When students construct ideas and communicate them to each other, they necessarily have to think about these ideas, which means that they are building memories. While this occurs no matter what students do, the focus is more likely to be on the thinking about their studies rather than other irrelevant activities.",

  "answer": "For many reasons, I undoubtedly prefer to learn from people and events in the past. First, people and events in the past offer a storehouse of information about how people and societies behave. Understanding the operations of people and societies is difficult. An exclusive reliance on current data would needlessly handicap our efforts. How can we evaluate war if the nation is at peace? We must resort to historical materials. Without them, how can we understand genius, the influence of technological innovation, or the role that beliefs play in shaping family life?Second, learning from the past also provides a terrain for moral contemplation. Studying the stories of individuals and situations in the past enables a student of history to test his or her own moral sense, to hone it against some of the real complexities individuals have faced in difficult settings. People who have weathered adversity — not just in some work of fiction, but in real life — can no doubt provide inspiration. Third, learning from the past provides identity. We can find evidence about how families, groups, institutions and whole countries were formed, and about how they have evolved while retaining cohesion. Concisely, we get to know how we ended up being us.",

Managers are supposed to set examples and be role models. So, as a “manager friend,” you’re either going to be a boring uptight friend, or an unprofessional, immature manager. You pick. And oh, by the way, your own manager may not appreciate those pictures of you and the gang all over employee Facebook pages. Can you socialize with your employees? Or go out for a drink?

  "answer": "I do not think a person needs talent to become an artist. This is because I believe we are all artists.\\u2028To a lot of folks, artistic talent is whatever the old masters were doing, whomever you consider the old masters to be. In 1900, defining artistry may have entailed harking back to the Renaissance. And during the Renaissance, it probably involved fondly recalling ancient Greek and Roman art. But we should know creativity is within ourselves. Artistic talent is not simply the ability to do what's already been done. People have creative force churning within themselves. Their challenge is always the same: it is to take the risk of embracing their true nature and be themselves. Everybody burns with their special talent. We can all be artists if we truly believe.  \\u2028Continuing with this point, it is important to remember that art has different forms. So does the nature of artistic talent. Artistic talent is sometimes pure inspiration, or sometimes it’s forged through hard work; sometimes it’s innate, whereas other times it's nurtured. Anyone can make art. Anyone can study and practice and put in their 10,000 hours to become an artist. Harper Lee wrote only one novel, published at age 34, and changed the world of literature forever.

Academic standards and expectations have never been higher. Teachers have become more demanding, especially since they are now mainly rated on their students' academic performances. Students are forced to work hard, but hunger will distract them from their studies. Furthermore, students who suffer from anaemia sometimes need to eat in classes.\\u2028Also, eating in class contributes to an active physical condition, which allows students to keep up the pace. Many students are involved in athletics and other extracurricular activities, in which coaches and club advisors can be very demanding. Students constantly need to keep their bodies fueled, so proper nutrition and hydration is a must.\\u2028Finally, the short duration of mealtimes typical in schools may limit the intake of energy. Lunchtime is simply not long enough for students to relax and sufficiently nourish themselves, especially considering that school starts at seven and most students engage in extracurricular sports. It would neither take very long nor be very distracting to have a cheese stick or chocolate bar at hand; but it would help students to have a more enjoyable school day, which would in turn improve their focus and, consequently, their grades.",

Teenagers are known to voraciously seek novelty, risk and sensual arousal.The teenage brain — which is undergoing explosive neurological development — is also particularly vulnerable to distraction and peer pressure. The front portion of the brain — which governs one’s impulses, judgment and ability to multitask — doesn't mature till the late 20s. All these reasons make sixteen-year-olds unsuited to driving. ",

Students who know what they want to work as after graduation should select their major according to their chosen career. Although a major doesn’t necessarily dictate a certain job, it does help to ease the process of entering into your desired career path. For example, studying biology instead of computer networking will help if you wish to enter medical school and will thus enable you to become a doctor. \\u2028Additionally, market demands should also be considered.

  "answer": "Students in the front row tend to be more eager, like a particularly chatty person at a bar. Their seating choice says: “I want to be part of the conversation.” It also says: “I’m smarter and I’m getting an A in this class.” Can’t a teacher spot this strategy? Of course. However, the teacher has seventy-five minutes to kill and it’s a lot easier when people participate. They are consequently unlikely to discriminate against the eager. The students who sit at back do so because it allows them to goof off without getting caught. Some kids may also dislike sitting close to their teacher.",

Life expectancy north of the Huai River is 5.5 years lower than in the south due to air pollution.\\u2028Severe droughts and water contamination have compounded desertification.

However, this music needs to be of slow to medium pace and should not contain vocals or loud drum beats! Music can affect you in a variety of ways.

Unfortunately, the operation was unsuccessful and her face was ruined. \\u2028There is no doubt that this overly-aesthetic outlook is destroying our already limited passion and belief. This plastic surgery culture has been shaped by lowbrow programs ranging from Chinese idol shows to Korean soap operas. These shows imply that plastic surgery leads to beauty, success and happiness. Natural beauty should be held in a higher regard. ",

You do not have to tiptoe around it. It will not bite you. For me, learning how to read poetry aloud is relatively straightforward and can be mastered with practice.\\u2028Performing a poem can offer pleasures unlike any other literary experience. “Words mean more than what is set down on paper,” the poet Maya Angelou writes, “it takes the human voice to imbue them with the shades of deeper meaning.” But approaching a poem as a script for an oral performance demands that we pay attention to aspects of the work that we aren’t used to looking for.

This painting was done in oil paints but because Monet used so little paint, it looks almost like watercolor.\\u2028The subject matter of this painting is water lilies in a pond. It is a landscape piece. While it is the second most important thing they paint in the Royal French Academy, the first being historical paintings, it is not done in their typical style. Because the paint in this painting was applied so lightly and delicately, it gives off a dreamlike feeling. The piece doesn’t remind the viewer of a traditional landscape, something Monet tended to avoid.\\u2028There is no specific organization or arrangement to the composition of this work of art. I believe he just painted as he saw fit. There might be a generic overall focal point in the center, but it is not a predominate one. The viewer becomes entranced by the artist’s use of brush strokes and the size of the whole work. Owing to its size, one’s eyes are able to glaze over the entire painting and view it as a whole. There is no real sense of recession into space created by this piece.

  "answer": "Maybe it’s counterintuitive, but I think taking time to make decisions can actually improve your productivity and, therefore, happiness.\\u2028The more time you take making a decision, the more likely you’ll make the right choice. Sometimes the reason the decision-making process takes time is because you're not entirely sure which is the right option for you. Maybe your rational mind and your intuition are saying opposite things. Giving yourself more time to think about all the options — and each of their pros and cons — will become your savior. Taking time for consideration helps you to avoid jumping into something that might not be right for you.\\u2028Moreover, taking more time on decisions makes you more creative. If you have a big, important task ahead of you, it's natural to slow down because it's so daunting. What you might not realize is that even when you're not actively working on that task, your mind is subconsciously collecting ideas and processing things to prepare you for it. Consequently, when you actually sit down to begin, you have a better idea as to how to go about the task. ",

Since more people than ever are attending university today, jobs that were once considered entry-level now require a college degree from all applicants.

Lower skilled labor, like factory work, is becoming increasingly automated. Consequently, there is a huge demand for the highly educated in the present and the future job markets. Thus, the students who complete university to equip themselves with all the right knowledge and skills are not only ready to jump straight into their desired careers, they are also investing in their own potential with eyes on the future. Lastly, at university not only will you hopefully determine whether or not your intended career is the right fit, but you will also learn how to interact with other people and build your network. When you get out into the work world, you will need to work with a variety of different personalities, and college is a great time to start practicing.",

  "title": "Some universities have decided to force students who cheat to leave the school. Do you think this is a good idea? What are the advantages and disadvantages? Please include reasons and details in your explanation.",
  "answer": "For many reasons, I agree with the idea. Firstly, cheating is a form of lying and stealing. Each time you hand in schoolwork, you are basically telling the teacher that you completed that work on your own. That’s either true or, if you cheated on the work, a lie. Cheating is also stealing, because it involves taking someone else’s work and calling it your own. Secondly, cheating is unfair to others. Have you ever played a game by the rules only to have a friend who was so intent on winning that they cheated? Cheating is very frustrating when you are playing by the rules. When you cheat in school to get better grades, it’s unfair to the students who actually studied and did the work. You may also receive unfair and undeserved recognition for the better grade, which is truly immoral. \\u2028Thirdly, cheating can become a habit. People who cheat don’t usually do it one time. It becomes a habit that follows people throughout college and into their careers. Just like gambling or stealing, cheating can become a part of who you are and will spread into other areas of your life. Cheaters tend to lose perspective as to what is acceptable behavior and demonstrate a disregard for others.",

As Nunan (1991) wrote, “success is measured in terms of the ability to carry out a conversation in the language.” Therefore, if students do not learn how to speak or do not get any opportunity to speak in the classroom they may soon become demotivated and lose interest in learning.

Unlike cars, bicycles are one of the most sustainable forms of local transportation around; the only energy it uses is the amount your legs put into it. On top of this, it’ll also help keep you fit and healthy!Second, one of the biggest sources of waste is disposable items such as plastic forks, knives, spoons, cups, water bottles, and everything else which gets used once and then tossed in the trash. Students should buy nice reusable water bottles, instead of buying water every time they go out.But the best and most effective way to improve the campus’ environmental impact is for students to embrace a minimalist lifestyle.

Adequate open spaces, abundant resources, and clean air, soil and water – all of these, as well as other environmental factors, preserve the health of individuals and contribute to building a healthy community. All can be improved through the collection of litter.Furthermore, it encourages people to maintain the community both physically and socially. This engrains a community spirit in the population, which must be a good thing. Volunteering to collect litter will create a more pleasant and better quality of life. The physical attractiveness of the community and its recreational and relaxation opportunities will improve, making life more pleasant for community residents.

Through it I could learn penny-saving strategies, hone many financial skills, and become my own investment advisor. Second, the benefits from that class won’t decay as time goes by.

  "answer": "Being polite is common sense in today’s society and I think there are mainly two reasons why politeness is so important when communicating with others.\\u2028Firstly, politeness is more professional and makes your clients feel at ease and comfortable with you. For example, in Japan, retail clerks and customer service representatives are very polite when they greet customers, handle money and escort customers out of their shops. Their politeness puts customers at ease and makes the shopping experience more enjoyable.\\u2028Secondly, being polite helps to bridge social differences. This means being willing to accept or build a relationship with someone who has a different social background. For instance, only with politeness and respect can a person of Jewish faith accept and associate with someone of the Muslim faith. This shows a willingness to bridge cultural differences. You know, sometimes people of different faiths even fight with each other. That shows a refusal to look past social difference. Polite behavior bridges the gap between two people with different social backgrounds.",

Be focused on the job at hand and you’ll give a great speech. Second, he should focus on patterns, and try to develop a rhythm or flow.

Imagine, for example, you need to get to work at 9 a.m. You assume it takes exactly twelve minutes to get to work, so you leave at 8:48. If you miss one traffic light or have to run back inside to grab an umbrella, it becomes impossible to make it in on time. **Don’t chance it**. Lastly, before departure, it is important to calculate the time taken to commute to the location and to **be conservative** in the calculation. Don’t just give a **hazy time estimation**; calculate the full time taken to travel, including walking, waiting and locating. Then, add fifteen minutes on top of that **as a buffer** for any contingency scenarios or gaps you may have missed out.*****Notes**：**keeping yourself on track**：意为保持一致的 **losing track of time**：忽略了时间，在写作里常用的词汇 **contingency**：偶发事件 **Don’t chance it**：偏口语的描述，表示不要冒险 **be conservative**：意为在计算时间的时候要持保守的态度 **hazy time estimation**：模糊的时间评估 **as a buffer**：作为一个缓冲***",

We might still love sci-fi movies, but we're seeing the same weaknesses over and over again.\\u2028One of sci-fi’s main flaws is the fact that special effects often come before the plot. Certain directors don't even bother to construct a story, and their movies simply become two hours of exhausting explosions. *Transformers: Age of Extinction* is just one terrible example of this troubling trend. Another reason that I’m bored with sci-fi movies is because too often they remake or rip off a classic. Did the world need a remake of *The Day the Earth Stood Still*? Did 57 years of special effects development mean that the original movie was no longer good enough? A prime example of the degeneration of sci-fi is the fact many of its movies act predominately as toy adverts. Compared with the original Star Wars films, the new ones seem to be an excuse to fit as many toy friendly objects and characters into a movie as possible, missing the point of science fiction.",

In this sense, job hunting on the internet saves you money.

This can be done through joining a gym, finding a hobby that you enjoy, or, if you feel ready, signing up for internet dating. All of these measures will widen your social network and create common ground. After all, the more you have in common with the people around you, the easier it will be to interact and have conversations. “Don’t let your shyness be the source of anxiety. In fact, to learn that you're shy can be a useful stepping stone. Do you become shy when meeting new people, when interacting at a social gathering, or when speaking to someone to whom you find yourself attracted? Try to understand if your shyness manifests itself cognitively. When you have a better understanding of your shyness, you can figure out the best route to overcome it.” ",

If talent refers to some innate abilities such as “perfect pitch” (the ability to distinguish different pitches without looking at the keys) then my answer is a resounding “no.” Many people regard musicality as a symbol of innate talent. They think that a person without a natural flair for their chosen craft cannot become an artist. But the truth is, almost every skill can be acquired and refined through training.\\u2028I do not mean to deny the existence of innate talent. Of course, some of us are born with \\\"perfect pitch\\\" while others were not. This should not, however, determine whether a person can become a real artist. Talent proves futile in the absence of thousands of hours of practice distributed over a decade or more. In other words, those who show strong musicality but lack motivation to practice are less likely to succeed than a supremely dedicated, but less talented individual. \\u2028Besides, it is well known that, while accomplished musicians have key differences in their brains, this is achieved through training, not genetics. So really the true talent is something you acquire, not something that is bestowed upon a lucky few. I’m sure this rule applies to other forms of artistry too. ",

  "answer": "Turn your head and you will see art everywhere you look. Art is used by one and all. It forms a huge part of our daily lives. We see it in our houses, at the movies and in the books we read. The word \\\"art\\\" is a simple three letter term, one that is far harder to define than to spell.Beauty itself is a concept inextricably related to art. Painters who create beautiful pieces and musicians who produce beautiful songs are creating art because they are revealing their thoughts and feelings. Expression and beauty are key components in art. Moreover, art serves as an interactive tool for reluctant learners and young students. As these students grow up, they can relate art with their dreams and desires, thereby learning a lot about their abilities and capabilities. Additionally, art and writing go hand in hand. Hence, art is almost as effective as written things.",

  "answer": "When learning something new, I usually research information online first, which enables me to gather materials I need and then put what I’ve got into practice. For instance, when I learned Korean as a new language, the first thing I did was to sign up for a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) and took free online classes offered by universities and research institutions, which helped me learn the pronunciation of the letters. I then strived to use what I learned of the basic pronunciation to read some easy words. I also watched some Korean movies on the internet. After that, I found some language exchange groups through the internet. Through these groups I was able to meet up and speak Korean with a native speaker. This really helped me not only study Korean, but also know more about Korean culture. This is how I go about learning a new skill",

  "answer": "I believe in gifting something that meets the demands of the receiver. This is because, when a present makes the receiver’s life easier, the gift becomes priceless. Last year I started earning, and directly after I received my first payment, it was my dad's birthday. I never had bought a nice gift for him from my own money, so this time I wanted to get him something uncommon and personal. Parents are less frivolous than their children, and generally prefer practical gifts. I therefore started hunting for what my dad wants but doesn't have. After some days of observation, I realized that my dad has stopped using his wallet because he finds it very heavy and fat. It had become difficult for him to manage his wallet, and he consequently started using a small plastic bag to carry his money and cards. This was obviously problematic, so I ordered him a nice, slim and lightweight wallet online and gave it to him on his birthday. He was extremely happy with the gift and no longer needs to use the plastic bag. I was quite happy with the feeling that I could give him something that he really needed. ",

  "title": "Are eighteen-year-olds mature enough to vote?",
  "answer": "There are several arguments against eighteen-year-olds voting, most of which relate to the relative ignorance of youth. \\u2028First, most young people are not interested in politics. I’m sure everyone can find some thoughtful eighteen-year-olds who ought to vote, but if you go to any college campus and talk to the first thousand freshmen you meet, you’ll find five who are qualified to vote and eight hundred who don’t know who Churchill was.\\u2028Second, younger people are relatively inexperienced and therefore seldom possess the virtue of wisdom. People's votes will influence the direction of government in a certain way, but many young people don’t know what they’re voting for because they don't really know much about the issues facing society. They just listen to the propaganda coming from party political ads and vote based on what has the biggest emotional impact. In spite of this, I support the assertion that eighteen-year-olds should have the right to vote. I believe this for several reasons. First, some people might question the ability of young voters to cast a meaningful vote, but if these young citizens are old enough to drive, work without restrictions on their hours, and pay taxes, why shouldn’t they also have a voice in their local government? If they are not granted the right to vote, they are experiencing taxation without representation. Second, young people today are far better intellectually, physically, and emotionally equipped to partake in democratic procedures than past generations were. The young adult of today, for example, possesses unparalleled opportunities for education at high school level, which will enable them to think more profoundly and develop an informed political standpoint.

  "title": "What is the most effective way to resolve a disagreement between friends? Explain your answer. ",
  "answer": "Many superficial friendships end up being shelved after an argument because there isn’t enough depth to warrant all the trouble it takes to smooth over the disagreement. Unfortunately, even when the friendship reaches a deeper level, conflict continues to happen and can break apart a relationship. How can this be avoided? First and foremost, when you have a falling out with a good friend, try to gain an understanding of each other’s perspective. To help understand why a disagreement started, it may be beneficial to ask questions about each other’s point of view. It is important to make sure that when you are listening to the other person’s perspective, you are actually listening and not adding your opinion. You will have the opportunity to tell your side in due time. Also, it is important to avoid adding unnecessary drama. These things never help fix a problem and ultimately bring more hurt to all involved. Things like yelling, name calling, threatening to cut off the friendship, and personal attacks should be avoided at all costs. If it comes to that, walk away, breathe, step back and allow some time before you try again.\\u2028Last but not the least, agree to disagree. Resolving a conflict should not be seen as a contest to see who won or who was right or wrong. Even after taking steps to resolve a conflict, you still might not be able to agree. If you want to keep the relationship, it is okay to agree to disagree on an issue.",

  "title": "Do you agree that assignments handed in late should receive penalties? Explain your point of view. ",
  "answer": "This issue has many interesting points on both sides. Disagree:\\u2028First, late penalties lead to inaccuracy, which leads to deflated grades, which distorts the students’ capabilities; their true ability to meet the intended learning outcomes. In most jurisdictions (if not all), grades are supposed to reflect the student’s ability to meet the intended learning outcomes of the course they are enrolled in. I have never seen a curriculum guide that listed “handing in work on time” as a learning intention.\\u2028Second, late penalties are a waste of time. I think teachers should support the student rather than penalize them. I am not aware of any educational research that proclaims “late penalties” an effective practice. The threat of a penalty is supposed to motivate students to meet the deadline. Clearly, that threat isn’t working; for decades students have been penalized and but instances of lateness haven’t declined. \\u2028Agree: Are we arrogant or naïve enough to believe that school is primarily about the subject matter? Do you really think that the most important thing my seniors will learn is the value of the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890? No. Students go to school to learn the value of hard work. The assignment goes beyond simple “what do you know about x” and becomes a lesson in decision-making, bringing questions to the teacher, and being responsible enough to finish a set goal. Being late with assignments should have consequences, just like being late with payments — or for a job interview or date — does in the real world. ",

  "answer": "Teachers are sometimes concerned that online students aren’t learning enough. But research shows that online students perform just as well as traditional students.In some ways, online learning is even more effective than traditional methods. Online courses give students the opportunity to plan their study time around the rest of their day, instead of the other way around. Students can thus study and work when they are at their peak energy, whether that’s early morning or late at night. Course material is always accessible online, so there’s no need to schedule special trips to a library either.Moreover, online learning is more convenient. During snowstorms and thunderstorms, for example, colleges often cancel classes. If they don’t, students run the risk of injury in dangerous driving conditions. Rather than missing important classes, students in online courses can always “attend” by participating on discussion boards or in chat sessions, watching lectures or reading materials, and turning in their work on time.",

A number of depressing accusations and incidents plagued his private life; he faced continuous bad health and drug addiction. Such circumstances contributed to his death in the year 2009.

Financial factors are especially important for young people, since employment among the young has fallen significantly in recent decades. It’s undoubtedly cheaper to live at home. Believe it or not, you're usually less of a financial burden on your parents when you’re at home. Many young people move out only to come back needing money. Your bills when living at home are a lot less than when you're out on your own. It's thus a good idea for strapped-for-cash young adults to save for the future and live with their parents.\\u2028Secondly, the nostalgia factor plays a big part. Where else can you feel as safe, comfortable and content as the place you’ve spent your entire life?

Shortcuts, moreover, are unacceptable in inclusive classrooms as they will only leave students with less than they need for an effective learning experience.

  "answer": "For many reasons, I would become a painter. First, there are a multitude of inner movements that I go through when creating a painting: the joy of seeing one’s vision become reality, the confidence of repeated brushstrokes and the pace of emotions within are just a few. Moreover, to paint is to show a bit of my soul. Where words fail, colors and strokes step up to the plate. Deep-seated subconscious thoughts come to life, and painting becomes a way of connecting with your inner self. And, more often than not, we are surprised with what we find. The self-discovery element of painting is most enthralling. Finally, as time goes by, painting chronicles our life. When used like a journal or diary, a painting allows us to see the ups and downs of life, offering perspective. When I look back at my drawings and paintings, I see a different person from long ago. As a painter once wrote, “painting is my predilection, my way or tool to evolve, to ‘know’.” Credit：Ansely",

Such creativity makes time go much faster, as you will begin to enjoy yourself. \\u2028Second, dynamic jobs will help you to hone your multitasking skills. Office assistants, for instance, learn to become master-multitaskers because their work days are so varied – their tasks include scheduling, answering phone calls and greeting visitors, often at the same time. The biggest challenge is to manage the constant interruptions when performing. These interruptions become new tasks within your goal and often dictate the rhythm of your workday. Through this, you'll learn how to pace yourself and be as efficient as possible. These are reasons why I prefer a job dealing with different tasks.",

The fields of science, technology, mathematics, or others would never have advanced beyond their first practitioner. For example, Galileo proved that two objects of a different weight could reach the ground at the same time from the same height just because he doubted Aristotle's assertion. A great teacher gives students knowledge and perspective, but simultaneously provides opportunity and motivation to explore their own theories and research.\\u2028Second, like anything else in life, some people are good at their profession and some are not so good.

Homestays, for instance, can be found for very little per night depending on the location. Through pre-planning and a little creativity, the financial burden of accommodation can be significantly reduced. Another tip is cooking for oneself. Most types of accommodation include simple cooking items such as pots and pans. Simply visit a convenience store and pick up some simple yet delicious food to cook for yourself. Credit: Exxson",

  "title": "Which of the following occupations do you consider the most important for a city, a policeman, a public transportation worker, or a building designer?",
  "answer": "A policeman, as it is not only a hugely important occupation for a city, but also is highly respected in our wider society.Policemen try their best to save lives every day. In our minds, policemen are always pulling victims out of burning cars or providing **first aid** and basic life support to shooting victims. There are other duties of policemen that influence our lives. For example, speeding tickets improve traffic safety. Furthermore, policemen can sometimes act as life mentors to people who are on the **wrong path**. **Drug addicts**, **gang members** and thieves, people who do harm to the city, are timid when they encounter policemen. Policing is an opportunity to show these people a better way, which may play a huge role in their future lives. Finally, policemen have abilities to deal with varied problems. Police work is some of the most varied out there; one day you could be doing paperwork and filing, the next you are out on the street. A wide range of different accidents happen in the city every day, and no one can solve such troublesome problems as quickly and efficiently as policemen.*****Notes****1.

  "answer": "Doing things you love in your spare time will make you happier and more energetic. The same applies to your job. As Confucius said, “choose a job you love and you will never have to work a day in your life.” There's never been a better time to start looking for your dream job. If you do something simply because you love it, or something that is logically going to lead to something you love, you will likely do your best work. That desire will make you more creative and more resourceful, and will help you get further faster. You will develop a newfound appreciation for life. ",

  "answer": "There are two solutions to deal with friends who are always late. The first is to try to understand why they're chronically late. It's probably not because they're selfish or on a power trip. It’s more likely that they're not good at foreseeing how long things will take, or perhaps they have a chaotic life. When you see the cause behind the symptom, it's easier to not get angry. Once you understand the root of the problem, you can adjust your expectations and behavior. If you don't expect them to be on time, you won't be quite as disappointed when they aren't. And if you don't expect them to be on time, you can be late too! And, if for some reason the universe stops and they're on time the one time you're late, tell 'em it's a taste of their own medicine. Do they like their time being wasted? Probably not.",

Firstly, I do not think that the government is qualified to determine who is talented and who is not. If we were to give so-called “talented children” better opportunities when we lack a clear and reasonable standard, the whole exercise will be counterproductive. Secondly, the government should be more focused on formulating policies which ensure equal opportunities of development for children in poverty. Talented children are already more likely to achieve success than ordinary people, so the government’s responsibility lies in empowering the oppressed. ",

  "title": "Do you prefer to travel alone or with others?",
  "answer": "I think, for many reasons, that traveling alone is more rewarding. Firstly, if you've ever been on a trip with others you will know it's rare that everyone wants to see and do the same things. We only have so much time, so compromises need to be made, and sometimes our activities get pushed to the wayside. When we travel alone, we are in charge. That means we can plan our days however we want, and we don’t have to worry about compromising and making sacrifices. Secondly, traveling with people we know creates a comfort zone that can be hard to get out of. The people we're with can also unintentionally block us. Once we leave our comfort zone and take the plunge, we’ll feel a sense of empowerment. A successful solo vacation can inspire us to tackle the things in life we’ve been afraid to try. I highly recommend taking a solo trip at some point in your life. Credit: bxr1994",

  "answer": "Elementary schools should teach children how to cook. As children are becoming more self-reliant, it becomes increasingly important to impart food-related knowledge. Moreover, cooking is a way to talk about health. It’s been said that food is medicine, and children are more willing to try new healthful foods while nutrition principles taught in the classroom become more relevant. Also, cooking projects give children a boost in confidence, and often inspire the curiosity and motivation needed to continue cooking at home. Finally, cooking teaches children appreciation. Young children may not be grateful now, but the time will come when they need to put food on the table. It will one day help to know that mother boils the water before she dumps in the pasta. They may have a better idea of the fact that food doesn’t just happen.",

  "answer": "I believe that the government should do more to encourage people to lead healthy lives. This is primarily because, if the number of people who suffer from diseases increases, it will become more difficult to maintain health insurance systems. We would then have to pay more taxes to support medical services. I heard that in some countries, foods containing high fat or sugar — such as cheese, chocolates and sugary drinks — are heavily taxed in order to prevent people from overindulging. I think this is a good idea because obesity increases the risk of contracting diabetes and developing heart conditions.Furthermore, governments would be wise to remember that health is the most important thing in the world. Thanks to the development of technology, we can now do various things without moving much, if at all. Consequently, people are far more likely to develop obesity and metabolic syndrome. The government should thus do something to encourage people to exercise more. This can be achieved through building public gyms. In summary, I think everyone should make more of an effort to stay healthy, and the government should also support us in this. ",

Life drawing is a consistently rewarding form of artistic expression, one that deserves constant practice. As an art student, drawing is nothing new to me, but practicing during class is simply not enough. I therefore joined the club as an extension. One of the benefits of joining is that free models are made available to club members. Compared to photos, real models allow you to turn your head or body and fully understand three-dimensional figures. The group experience accelerates the process of practicing, and brings pleasure too.

One of art’s primary functions is bridging the gap between cultures. Through art we gain a better understanding of cultures, both past and present. Art is without barriers of distance or language; it is universal. Through art we are able to get a glimpse of the nature of another person’s existence. It is a powerful tool that can improve communication and relationships between cultures. Also, art makes a huge difference in our daily lives. Art can make a community more beautiful; it can make our workplaces more interesting and inspirational; it can make us happy; and it can even motivate us.

Children are like sponges, as they absorb everything they see, hear, smell or touch. Drawing can therefore become an important form of expression in their development. Secondly, drawing boosts kids’ confidence. It is often a child’s first creative activity, so praising a child’s drawing will boost their confidence from the outset. In addition, drawing gives your kids time to concentrate. During those precious minutes of drawing, children's attention and concentration skills are honed.

Speaking a second language will be undoubtedly beneficial upon their return home as well. Furthermore, studying abroad fosters independence.

This is firstly because you may find it hard to stay on track when your group gets together. The conversation shifts from course material to current events, maximizing distractions as the clock ticks away. Studying alone allows you to concentrate and minimize the disruptions that can keep you from your work. It’s easier to avoid temptations when you work alone, which results in fewer interruptions. Also, sometimes study partners are not as knowledgeable as you are. Sometimes they want to spend hours studying a topic that you already know like the back of your hand. When you study on your own, you’re able to completely focus on the material you choose, and spend less time on material you’ve already mastered.

  "answer": "I think delivering assignments via email is better.\\u2028First, it is unrealistic for students to do their best work when using the single draft method, as it doesn’t permit them to dig further into the question. Moreover, inspiration may spring out at anytime and anywhere, and thus assignments handed in by email can incorporate all sudden ideas. \\u2028Furthermore, the email method facilitates more efficient feedback. Its role in the learning process is not simply one of information processing, but allows unique feedback that influences the learner’s working processes. ",

Half of your genetic material comes from your mother, and she is thus **inexorably and fundamentally** a part of you. **The same goes for** your father. Family cannot, therefore, be replaced. By contrast, friends can be replaced. It may not sound like something you can put on a **Hallmark card**, but it's true. Furthermore, the job of a friend is different from that of, say, a parent or a sibling. Family is tasked with basically forming who you are as a person—**instilling a work ethic**, **teaching you right from wrong**, standing by you in hard times, etc. Yes, people like to say that friends will always be there, but they're not biologically obliged to.

It is paramount for college students to be concerned about politics.This is because politics has, and will continue to have, a huge effect on nearly every aspect of their lives. Whether college students like it or not, politics plays a prominent role in their daily lives, ranging from the amount of tax they pay for morning coffee, to how much tuition they pay each year.Since politics impacts the various choices they make, why not take the time to understand how the process works? Who makes laws and how do these laws influence lives? Understanding this can liberate college students to determine the best course of action for themselves and their families with regards to a wide range of issues, most of which are more important than coffee and tuition. ***Notes：**1.

So, why don’t you head to class and make that $50 worthwhile?\\u2028Second, alongside missing out on crucial content, you'll also fail to learn what you don’t need to know.

  "answer": "As a student, I often find myself wanting to voice my ideas on how to strengthen the efficacy of our school systems. I believe that students should have the ability to evaluate their teachers, for many reasons. \\u2028First, students, through evaluating their teachers, can provide insight on what their instructors are doing well and how they need to improve. These evaluations, instead of being used in performance review processes and being used to decide pay or job security, should be accessed solely by the teachers about whom they’re written. As a result of this confidentiality, teachers can learn how to improve their instruction quality, without fearing retribution from administrators. The evaluations can be a tool for growth, not as a cause of stress.\\u2028A criticism of the system is that it turns students against professors. This argument is unfounded. If anything, academic evaluations improve the symbiotic relationship between learner and teacher. With the education reform debate becoming increasingly polarized, students evaluating teachers in a confidential way shows that collaboration in education is possible. As students, we are not out to fire teachers or reduce their pay. All we want is a platform upon which we can express our opinions and better our education.",

Rich in fat, fast food can lead to many health problems such as obesity, heart disease and diabetes. Moreover, eating too many carbohydrates like hamburgers and pizzas will affect your mood and may cause depression and anxiety. It makes sense, then, that people who regularly eat fast food are 51% more likely to become depressed, according to a study.\\u2028The plan will also combat another of the problems associated with fast food — that it drains your wallet. A lot of people justify their fast food habit based on cost, often saying that they “want something cheap and easy.” But the fact is that you are likely to actually spend more money on fast food than you would if you cooked. We can say with some confidence that by ending the provision of fast food in the canteen, students will become healthier and wealthier. ",

  "answer": "I would say the following:“Life as an undergraduate university student is incredibly enriching on intellectual, emotional, and social levels.\\u2028“When first arriving on campus, you should book a meeting with your advisor, and listen to their advice. Advisors know the ins and outs of your program, and paying attention to them will help you in the long run.\\u2028“Also, university is a lot about managing your time; getting to classes, dealing with emails, writing assignments, planning for exams, and squeezing in a social life can be quite the juggling act. To ease the pressure, it is important to develop a clear and straightforward calendar. Include your class schedule, important dates and meetings, and, most importantly, look at the calendar regularly. A good system for your agenda and tasks will make your life a lot easier.”",

  "answer": "Firstly, it is important to practice responses to typical job interview questions and answers most employers ask. Think of **concrete examples** you can use to **highlight** your skills. The easiest way to do this is to make a list of the job requirements and match them to your experiences. Providing evidence of your previous accomplishments is a great way to promote your **candidacy**.Second, be on time for the interview. In this case, “on time” means five to ten minutes early. **If need be**, take some time to drive to the interview location ahead of time so you know exactly where you are going and how long it will take to get there. Give yourself a few extra minutes to visit the restroom, check your outfit, and calm your nerves.Thirdly, during the job interview, try to relax and stay as calm as possible. Remember that your body language **says as much about you as** your answers to the questions. Proper preparation will allow you to **exude confidence**. Take a moment to **regroup** if you need it. Maintain eye contact with the interviewer. Listen to the entire question before you answer, and pay attention – you will be embarrassed if you forget the question.***Notes**1.

  "answer": "I was once an exchange student, so I have my own views on the differences between private schools and state schools.\\u2028First of all, I was really impressed by the difference in class sizes between the two schools. State school class sizes can be as large as 40 students, whereas private school class sizes seldom exceed 20! \\u2028Besides, the standard of teachers is another major difference between these two kinds of schools. This is largely because, while state school teachers do need to be certified, private school teachers are often experts in their fields, just like my music teacher Mr. Lin. It is very difficult to remove state school teachers, but private school teachers generally have contracts that are renewable each year.",

Although she lived in Brazil for only a short time, she became regarded as an “MPB (Brazilian popular music) ambassador” in Japan.

The lack of payment is no reason to get out of household tasks. If parents pay children money for household tasks, what happens when those tasks don’t get done? \\u2028Second, by paying children for household work — though you may be teaching your kids the value of work — eventually money ceases to be a stimulant. If they have plenty of money, they will simply refuse to do their chores and the house will descend into bedlam. Instead, encourage your children to be more active in the household and fulfil their familial responsibilities. ",

Used books are obviously more affordable, but their other benefits far outweigh this. They often have margin notes, little insights into the mind of their previous owners. Some of such notes offer fresh perspectives on the themes, while others offer intimate and rare glances into another person’s reading experience. There’s something innately whimsical about margin notes — they are a way to literally leave your mark. Of course, there are exceptions. Used versions of Stephen King’s sequel to _The Shining_ or the final instalment of Margaret Atwood’s _MaddAddam_ trilogy won’t exactly be floating around in abundance right now. But as far as I’m concerned, a previously owned book should be opted for whenever possible.",

Before Taobao, I had to take a one-and-a-half-hour subway to go shopping in the city malls. This was an incredibly tiresome experience. Now I can find similar or even identical clothes on Taobao for a lower price. \\u2028In addition, shopping on Taobao is very safe. This is because the site ensures account privacy.

  "title": "“University freshmen should have a car.” Do you agree? ",
  "answer": "I wholeheartedly disagree with the statement. In fact, I think that freshmen should be banned from bringing their cars to campus.\\u2028First, leaving cars at home can encourage students to stay on campus and become more involved in campus life. Actively involved students are better students academically, and are often happier than other students in their social lives. Also, they are often more satisfied students who remain at the institution. Students who head off campus for all of their activities, or who head home several times a week, or every weekend, are not as involved on campus. \\u2028Having a car can also distract from study. A car is an incredibly costly piece of machinery, with gas, repairs, registration, insurance and parking permits all having to be considered. Consequently, students will end up having to work — and thus take time away from studying and activities — simply to pay for the car. Keeping students on campus will help them to stay focused on coursework.",

From personal experience, I know that this method is effective. Since my parents started working out and eating healthily, I have changed my diet and started going to the gym myself.

It only takes about ten minutes of class time for students to fill out a form and, nowadays, the laborious task of transcription can be automated. The last step, comparing the average rating of any instructor to the average for the whole department, is also simple. However, the system is also rife with disadvantages. There is compelling empirical evidence suggesting that student evaluations are only tenuously connected to overall teaching effectiveness. It is particularly influenced by factors unrelated to learning outcomes, such as the gender, ethnicity and attractiveness of the instructor. So, no matter how easily evaluations can be carried out, they shouldn’t be. ",

If you want happiness for a lifetime, help somebody.” For centuries, happiness has always been found in helping others.\\u2028This is primarily because helping friends with their problems can help build lasting bonds. A study by the National Institutes of Health, for example, shows that when you help others, you give off positive vibes, which can rub off on your peers and improve friendships.\\u2028Moreover, helping someone out can leave you feeling rewarded and fulfilled.

If you plan to go traveling and your partner cancels on short notice, pack your bags and go anyway. You will not regret it. \\u2028Traveling alone also helps you stay within your budget. Money is always a pressure point when it comes to travel, and everyone has different spending habits and attitudes.

It shows that candidates are responsible, courageous and able to cope with life on their own. After all, many employers are looking for employees with initiative and the ability to act independently. We have all seen those television programs of holiday reps rolling around drunk and partying hard in what many would consider as their ideal jobs. In reality, however, the travel industry frowns upon such activities and would far prefer candidates who are responsible and trustworthy. Being a holiday rep requires a large amount of responsibility; you are in charge of a large group of people and must ensure that first they are safe, but also that they have a good time while they are on holiday. You must also represent the holiday company at all times and all of the principles it stands for; providing good customer service is a large part of this job role. Specialist skills are largely needed in the travel industry for all manner of jobs. Instructors in fields such as diving, horse riding and golf are usually required in many resorts. These types of jobs could well be considered the jackpot. Workers are able to do the things they love in the sun. Golf tutors are especially needed in Spanish resorts where golf is increasingly becoming a part of many holidays. The value of an instructor who can speak English cannot be understated.

  "answer": "Conflict is a fact of life, a fact that becomes far more likely when you develop a friendship with someone. Here are some solutions.\\u2028First, talk the situation over soon after it occurs. From my experience, people begin to gossip almost as soon as an incident occurs, and begin to pick sides. The gossip circulates and, all of a sudden, friends become enemies. So, be sure to talk with the person with whom you are upset without the interference of people who aren’t really involved.\\u2028Second, resolve it the day it happens. One rule my parents follow in their marriage is that they always attempt to resolve things the day it happens so that in the morning, it’s a fresh start with no past grudges. Whatever you do, don’t let things ride for too long.\\u2028Last but not least, try to see the other person’s perspective. Realize that everyone has been created differently with various talents, abilities and personality traits.",

  "answer": "I would definitely choose essay questions. Essay questions allow students some time to think about, organize and compose their answers. Reading about something or hearing about it and even discussing it can help students retain and understand information, but having to process that information in a way that then requires them to articulate it in writing gives them another chance to think through it and explain, in their own words, what they've learned. Furthermore, they can serve as a feedback mechanism for the instructor. This can be true of all test questions, but essay questions can provide the instructor with insight into possible misunderstandings students have of the material. This helps the instructor improve the material for future lessons.",

  "answer": "Of course it is important for us to learn about different cultures. Learning about a different culture can provide another perspective. Other cultures provide different ways of looking at the world and our place in it. They show why what you or your culture think of as \\\"right\\\" might not be. Other cultures also show how we all have a lot — and I mean _a lot_ — in common.\\u2028Also, learning about different cultures will teach us how to act when visiting a new country, or even someone’s house from a different cultural background. This is useful in order to avoid offending the host and creating embarrassment. \\u2028The most important reason is, however, that learning about different cultures is an effective weapon against ignorance. Without an understanding of different cultures, how can one understand the history of religious tolerance in the Middle East, for instance? Ignorance is the primary cause of xenophobia; the more you understand a culture, the less you fear them. Knowledge should result in a newfound love of humanity. ",

The material to be covered and the design of each lesson are carefully spelled out in detail. A textbook gives you all the plans and lessons you need to cover a topic in some detail. It also provides teachers with a balanced, chronological presentation of information.\\u2028Second, children need textbooks that support their learning experiences. Textbooks are better than online resources or paper handouts in several ways. They are easier to access and much easier to refer back to. They are also an immeasurable help to children who may have started a course late, or who have missed a large piece of work. ",

  "answer": "For the following reasons, I certainly believe that they should. \\u2028Firstly, governments themselves will profit from promoting healthier lifestyles. Through improving the general health of the population, the government will not have to invest so much time and money in health services. Reducing the sugar intake, for instance, may result in lowering rates of diabetes and obesity. It’s a great deal for the government.\\u2028The second reason is that healthier people usually have a smaller carbon footprint. Through encouraging people to walk or cycle in their daily commute, emissions will be reduced. The government would be killing two birds with one stone, and could therefore spend less on environmental protection. ",

It's a great time to make mental to-do lists, brainstorm for work, and daydream about weekend plans. Going solo means it's really \\\"me\\\" time.\\u2028Secondly, being able to work out alone is one of god’s little gifts to sweaty people — those who are trying to get into shape but aren’t so good at it yet.

I recently heard some of my friends complain that their parents ask them to save money. This complaint is even more unreasonable because all too often young people are impulsive buyers, so family rules about saving money cannot be ignored.

  "answer": "The style of clothing in China has dramatically changed over the years. People in ancient China generally wore tunics (long t-shirts). Women wore long tunics down to the ground, with belts, and men wore shorter ones down to their knees. By the 1920s, a stylish and often tightfitting _cheongsam_ or _qipao_ was created in Shanghai, and was thereafter made fashionable by socialites and upper-class women. The original qipao was wide and loose. It covered most of the woman's body, revealing only her head, hands, and the tips of her toes. With time, though, the qipao were tailored to become more form fitting and revealing. After the Qing Dynasty fell, people eagerly sought a more modernized style of dress and transformed the old qipao to suit their tastes. Slender and form fitting with a high cut, it contrasted sharply with the traditional qipao. Since then, Chinese fashion has undergone some more drastic transformations. Following the relaxation of communist clothing standards in the late 70s, people began to express themselves more vividly through their clothing. Contemporary urban clothing seems to have developed an obsession with brand names.",

I do not mean to say that electronic books can't be beautiful, but never can they rival the tangible beauty of a physical copy. Second, physical books often have sentimental value attached to them. Most books have been around for a very long time, and people can often develop an emotional bond with them. Books given by friends, for instance, can be precious gifts.

In order to keep up the pace, students constantly need to keep their bodies fueled, making proper nutrition and hydration a must. Second, eating five to seven times per day in a grazing manner — with a good blend of protein, healthy carbohydrates, healthy fats, and lots of water —  is the best method to keep the brain and muscles fueled, the metabolism moving, and blood sugar levels constant.

  "answer": "Living in a native home offers students the opportunity to experience a plethora of benefits while studying in a foreign place.\\u2028The first of these is that your host family will push you to learn the second language you’re studying and will serve as a tangible pay off for your efforts. If you make an effort to interact with your hosts, I’m sure you’ll have ample opportunity to try out new phrases and even begin conversing. It’ll definitely give your years of language learning an authentic upgrade. More importantly, becoming a part of a host family is an end in and of itself. Living in a family environment can help foreigners feel at home in a foreign land and especially help combat any feelings of homesickness. If you form a strong bond, it also gives students the chance to gain aunts, or uncles in a foreign land. Talk about networking! ",

  "answer": "I believe critical thinking is one of the most important skills for us to improve the education system in my country. Critical thinking is the ability to analyze the way you think and present evidence for your ideas. I believe my country fails to engrain this crucial skill in its students. \\u2028Firstly, good critical thinking is the foundation of science and a liberal democratic society. Science requires the critical use of reason in experimentation and theory confirmation. Any functioning liberal democracy requires citizens who can think critically about social issues and inform their judgments about proper governance. Without critical thinking, prejudices and bias are impossible to overcome. \\u2028Moreover, critical thinking promotes creativity. To come up with a creative solution to a problem involves not just having new ideas. It must also be the case that the new ideas being generated are useful and relevant to the task at hand. Critical thinking plays a crucial role in evaluating new ideas, selecting the best ones and modifying them if necessary. ",

Judging by the extensive use of praise for products in ads, a significant amount of people do believe the praise is somehow — even though they are unwilling to buy, or at least try — truly representative of the product.\\u2028Second, advertisers particularly want to familiarize people with their brands. This is why brand logos are everywhere. Not only on the products themselves, but on trucks, pens, shirts and so on. Your decision is thus being made subliminally by a marketing department. ",

  "answer": "In recent years, more countries are opening their doors and welcoming huge numbers of tourists. The outcomes are almost entirely positive. \\u2028This is firstly because international tourism creates jobs, both through direct employment within the tourism industry, and indirect employment in sectors such as retail and transportation. The tourism industry also provides opportunities for small-scale business enterprises, which is especially important in rural communities. Second, as foreign tourists tend to flock towards countries with a strong cultural heritage, international tourism encourages the preservation of traditional customs, handicrafts and festivals that might otherwise have been allowed to wane. This creates civic pride. Interchanges between hosts and guests create a better international cultural understanding and can also help raise global awareness of issues such as poverty and human rights abuses.",

  "answer": "No plan is the best plan.\\u2028This is because no fixed schedule means it’s impossible to get stuck in a bad plan or be in a terrible mood. Plan makers are prone to go crazy if random factors such as bad weather foul up the plan. If the accommodation sucks, you can switch to a new one. Without a plan, the trip can be fluid and dynamic.\\u2028Moreover, traveling without the confinements of a super rigid plan furnishes you additional time to dive into the local life. You have the advantage of sitting in a nearby bistro, soaking in the vibe without having to worry about rushing to your next scheduled program. That excited feeling of not knowing where you’ll be headed or what you’ll be doing next makes the experience 100 times richer.",

  "answer": "I disagree. I believe that it is equally important to maintain both relationships.\\u2028Generally speaking, in any society, family is an important unit and plays a crucial role in instilling values and teaching responsibilities. Good relationships with family members will not only help in creating a stable unity and positive connection, but also offer us a sense of belonging and allow us to get lots of benefits through solving misunderstandings.\\u2028Besides our relationship with family, friendships are also essential, especially when we are facing hardships and adversities of life. As the philosopher Aristotle said, “In poverty and other misfortunes of life, true friends are a sure refuge.” Securing true friendship is extremely valuable in all areas of life. Friends act as the magic that makes our lives meaningful and memorable. Thus, both family members and friends are the people we can’t afford to live without, losing either of them will make us vulnerable.  To sum up, we both know that a close friend is a mirror that represents part of ourselves while family members will always stand as our source of motivation and inspiration to move forward. Losing either of them will definitely cover us with a feeling of darkness. I sincerely wish that everyone has the opportunity to share their smiles and tears with both family members and friends.",

We are often distracted by other people and thus we completely silence our own heart and forget what truly matters to us.

The real experiences of others lend context to the decisions and consequences that we face. One of the best ways to take advantage of the experiences of great people is by reading their biographies. I have recently been reading about Elizabeth Holmes and she has become something of a distant mentor to me. Admittedly, not every biography is about a “giant” but most are.

There's also a nostalgic appeal to letter writing. When I was in college, I studied abroad in England for three months and I still remember the excitement I felt in receiving a mail from my family.

This is because two key points of preservation can’t be achieved without the government’s participation. The first one is the conservation of natural reserves. Because such reserves are usually vast, they can often cross borders and be placed in two or more different states. The government must, therefore, be involved in brokering a deal with the other state to reach a consensus and implement a conservation program. The second one is hunting bans. Faced with poachers, who have real guns, posters and bans are futile. Only armed forces authorized by government have the approval and ability to stop them. ",

There are several strands of evidence which point towards the importance of play in children's development, and the value of an extended period of playful learning before the start of formal schooling seems paramount. Play supports children in developing their skills of intellectual and emotional “self-regulation,” which are crucial in early learning and development. It is claimed that the current education system robs infants of the ability to play and puts too much emphasis on formal learning at a young age. Forcing kids to start reading at four is a disaster. There's no need for it and no sense to it. Some kids just aren't ready, so it risks putting them off for life.",

Traveling is well-known to be the best way of learning new languages. A textbook can't teach you slang, intonation or vocal expression, native speakers sure can. Not only will conversing help expand your cultural horizons, but it will also hasten your listening and speaking capabilities. Learning on the go also allows you to explore cultural differences. Different cultures prefer different types of cuisine, manners and social expectations. In communicating and interacting with other cultures, you'll find just how they vary from your own. What could be a more important life lesson than this?For the third point, it makes you capable of adjusting to changing circumstances. The very act of traveling is a test of one's will, patience and fortitude. Even the most well-planned traveler will often see his or her plans go awry.

So, dates are important because without them, a lot of information about an artefact would be unknowable.  Second, as history is all about knowing the past, it is important to know when something has happened as well as what happened.

  "answer": "Borrowing money is seldom a good idea. Waiting and saving until you can afford an item is almost always better than borrowing. It's not as easy to borrow as it used to be since lenders have tightened up their lending criteria. So, if you want a loan, you usually have to complete an application form and the lender then checks your credit rating. Even if the loan is eventually approved, people usually have to pay interest when borrowing money, be it a loan, overdraft, hire purchase or credit card. If you borrow 1,000 dollars for a year and the interest rate is 10%, for instance, you end up paying back 1,100 dollars. But if you save 1,000 dollars in a savings account, you will be the one to receive interest payments. Furthermore, during the process of saving money you are likely to be less frivolous, which will then stimulate you to develop more skills, provide more value and even make you become exceptional at the job you do. It is better to buy something using your own money, not the money of others. ",

  "answer": "Since I’ve ditched my cell phone, my life has been both wonderful and weird. Without a cell phone, you have to learn to react differently in simple situations. It’s like writing with your left hand; at first it feels weird, but over time it expands your mind and increases focus. And this type of activity significantly stretches your mind. I think that one of the pros of not using a cell phone is that it improves your sense of humor — when in a stressful situation, you laugh because of the path you’ve decided to take. For an example, when I was meeting up with my family at a hotel, I got to the building where they were staying, and suddenly it hit me — I had no idea what room they were in. In front of me were 14 rooms, and I had no way of knowing which one they were in. In the past, I’d simply make a quick call or send a short text and the predicament would be resolved. Now, the doors in front of me were not to 14 rooms, but to 14 possibilities. So, what did I do? I knocked on all 14 doors, and told 13 people, “Sorry, wrong room.” It was fun. It was simple. It got the job done. But this type of activity definitely takes a commitment.",

  "title": "Describe a change in your country. It could be a social, economical or political change. Explain how this change influenced people in your country. ",
  "answer": "The economic boom in China provided the post-80s generation with unprecedented opportunities. It was a significant change for a number of reasons. First, the economic boom boosted international trade, which exposed China to the individualistic West. Because of this, post-80s China became far more individualistic than it ever was before. In the past, Chinese people generally chose to go with the voice of the group instead of their own. However, the post-80s generation are more and more putting their own needs and wants first. They experiment with various ways to express their individualism. Another impact of the economic boom was the fact that people now feel less governed by authority. Previous Chinese family values and education systems discouraged dissent from — and challenges to — authoritative figures. But the post-80s generation was liberated from the authoritarian grasp of the state and free will has since blossomed. ",

Also, even creativity can be learned. Those who have no **natural inclination toward** creativity may develop it through experiences, travels, reading and learning.

But currently, a lot of people have rushed lifestyles and do not have the time nor inclination to carry a book around everywhere.

First of all, taking a difficult course helps you learn how to do difficult things. **As simplistic as this may sound**, people who have not attempted something difficult, or who have been protected from too many challenges, may not have the **coping skills** necessary when they confront something difficult in the future. While a difficult course may be a struggle right now, it will teach you important coping skills and strategies for the future. Second, by challenging yourself, you will **get your money’s worth out of** college. Hopefully, people attend college to learn. Avoiding difficult courses may mean that one also misses a great deal of knowledge, experiences and exposure to some great professors. Finally, you will feel good about yourself when you succeed.

Encourage children to communicate the ways in which he or she has demonstrated responsibility. Parents should also engrain in their children the importance of time management.

First, like all complex machines, cars and their components have projected operational lifespans. Manufacturers anticipate that some components will fail and that you'll need to replace them as part of routine maintenance. The long-life components will generally be costlier to replace, so knowing the price of replacing different car components is likely to save you money. Second, with routine car maintenance, your car will stay healthy. If you conduct regular inspections, tune-up services and replace parts, your car will continue running like it should.

For example, if a basketball coach focuses only on the team’s practice and not on the final result, victory is still possible for him. Once he neglects the process, results are likely to become unfavorable, leading to some negative behavior, such as excessive training, hesitation and over-analyzing. Second, concentration on the result reduces general well-being and prevents one from living in the moment. The problem with this mind-set is that you're teaching yourself to always put happiness off until the victory is achieved. However, if we commit to the process, happiness will be more accessible.",

Banning cell phones in public places is an effective way to reduce this phenomenon. Cell phones should be banned while driving. An English study found that talking on a phone while driving quadrupled the risk of an accident, making it nearly equal to the dangers of drunk driving. But cell phone prohibition shouldn’t be limited to vehicles. The banning of the devices should also extend to public places. Many people go to places such as libraries specifically to focus and do work. People who use their “cell yell” in such a setting distract others. Some cell phone chatter remains inappropriate for anyone to overhear, especially young children. These are the reasons why I support the idea that cell phones should be banned in some places. ",

The life of an artist is rife with trials and tribulations, and they thus need motivation to pursue their dreams and master their craft. Motivation also stimulates creativity, which is obviously a necessity for any artist.  The second one is being lucky enough to find themselves in nurturing environments from an early age. Mozart, for example, is often used as an example of innate talent, but even he was born to a father who not only composed for a living but also taught music. Before composing the beautiful works we know, Mozart had already put in thousands upon thousands of hours of rigorous training administered by his father. ",

The first interesting part of cheongsam **lies in** its purpose. It is designed to show off the natural female contour in a way that is practical yet sexy. Cheongsam shows the beauty, modesty and softness of a woman. Just like the **temperament of a Chinese woman**, this dress has a gentle and elegant appearance. And, of course, the **longstanding** elegance enhances the beauty and allure of the person who wears it.  The second interesting part of cheongsam is its **versatile functions**. In ancient times, cheongsams were worn as uniforms for everyday functions. Today, the dress is also worn to business meetings and even formal gatherings. This Chinese traditional dress is becoming international. Recently, a Hollywood actress wore a colorful, **stylish and sleek** cheongsam to a movie premiere. ***Notes：**1.

  "answer": "I agree with the statement. Even at my age, I can feel the pressure to pack my life full of activities. The benefits of relaxation are summarized below.\\u2028First, relaxation is perhaps the most important key to health and well-being. It is the antidote to stress — a feeling known to contribute to the development of disease. When we relax, our body has an opportunity to unwind.\\u2028Second, living a relaxed lifestyle makes us more productive. Most of us find ourselves unable to juggle overwhelming demands. Paradoxically, the best way to get more done may be to spend more time doing less. New research shows that strategic renewal — including daytime workouts, short afternoon naps, longer sleep hours, more time away from the office and longer, more frequent vacations — boosts productivity, job performance and, of course, health.",

  "answer": "I think it’s a good idea for the following reasons.\\u2028First, watching TV helps people unwind and escape from the pressures of their lives. I think the experience of sitting around with delicious snacks, watching a show you love in the company of roommates, is incredibly relaxing. Aside from the debatable benefits of TV as “downtime,” I think sharing TV shows with roommates is one of the most easily achievable pastimes friends can enjoy together.TV can also make you friends if handled correctly. A shared TV show gives you a shared vocabulary and a regular touchstone activity. One of my best friends and I bonded over _The Wire_, resulting in several all-night discussions of storytelling, society, and justice as a genre. It may be the nerdiest possible way on earth to spend an evening, but I would not trade those times for the world.",

  "answer": "I would suggest that my parents use the money to pay off debts. This is the most sensible suggestion for a number of reasons. First, debt repayment is an investment with a guaranteed return. If you pay off a credit card where you are paying a 10 percent interest, that will be the equivalent of earning a 10 percent rate of return on the same amount of money invested in another asset. Paying off debt can produce superior returns to most other investments and it is absolutely risk-free. Also, without the pressure of debt hanging over them, my parents’ lives after retirement will be infinitely more carefree. ",

It would also enable me to get a better view of the Earth, which would put my life into perspective. \\u2028The second reason is that the footage I will return to earth with will help build upon existing knowledge, giving people more ideas to expand inventions and make the old inventions better and more useful for their community and the world.

There's a chance of discovering an unexpected thrill, which cannot happen on recorded tunes. When you hear live music, you’re having a unique experience. This is something that cannot be replicated by simply purchasing the record. \\u2028Second, heavily processed and edited recordings can often lose feeling and emotion. Not only is live music more involving and interactive, but also the energy of musicians playing with and off of each other adds another dimension to the performance.

I don’t have to grovel, but I do need to bring respect to every interaction. I also need to understand my friend’s thoughts. Even if I think that I know my friend’s issue, it can't hurt to pose a direct question. Ask: “What’s your real concern here?” first, and then begin to figure out the disagreement. When I have a disagreement with my friend, I need to remember that I aim to clear the air rather than win the argument. In many instances, the disagreement will end peacefully, so it’s more important to focus on understanding why my friend thinks differently than I do than to try to emerge victorious. ",

  "answer": "Reading a book for the second time is a good idea because it feels like a different experience to the first read. Here are some of the benefits:\\u2028First, reading books multiple times encourages people to engage with the words emotionally. When people read through a book for the first time, they are focused on events and stories. During the next read, however, people are able to savor the emotional effects of the book more deeply and become more in touch with themselves.\\u2028Second, when people read the same book different times, they also feel different. As people age and gather experiences, their outlook and thus appreciation for literature changes. Rereading is thus never a waste of time. Not only do people get different things out of a book at different times of their life, but with each reread they will realize the significance of something that they overlooked before.",

Everybody should have a chance to learn, including older people. Many people assume that young people have a monopoly over receiving education. However, older people have successfully shown that they have the courage to learn and learn well.\\u2028Second, older people usually have a remarkable amount of experience to draw upon. They can combine theoretical and practical knowledge more competently than young people, and can thus, in some ways, learn more efficiently and thoroughly.\\u2028Therefore, it's never too late for older people to receive higher education.

  "answer": "Personally speaking, the most important quality of a working environment is a flexible schedule. I am this way inclined for the following reasons. \\u2028First, somewhat paradoxically, flexible schedules can actually have a positive impact on the productivity of employees. Employees who are better able to attend to family needs through flexitime are more likely to be contented and productive, while good employees who telecommute may get even more work done if they are freed up from office interruptions. In addition, businesses can also use flexible programs to address institutional problems. For instance, a small or mid-sized business that is crammed into a small facility or office may want to explore telecommuting programs in order to relieve the situation without resorting to an expensive relocation or expansion. Evidently, flexible schedules are crucial to any successful business. ",

These divergent \\\"shades of gray\\\" then cause miscommunication, breakdowns of trust, and other dysfunctional behaviors. That’s why lying, in whatever form, is so common in our lives.\\u2028Sometimes, telling the truth can hurt someone's feelings. When one of my friends gave me a gift I disliked for my birthday, for instance, I lied and told him that I liked it. I did not want to make him feel bad, because that would jeopardize our friendship.

Just like your car, your brain needs quality fuel to run efficiently. Eating a healthy, balanced diet, and making sure your brain has the fuel it needs, increases productivity at work.\\u2028Second, if you eat healthily, you’ll be less stressed. Certain foods have the ability to moderate our bodies’ levels of cortisol, the stress hormone. When the body is in a chronic state of stress, it breaks down protein to prepare for battle. Eating a protein rich diet, including fish and dairy, can help replenish protein stores and keep cortisol levels at bay.",

They frolic with their childhood playmates in the sand, mud or water.\\u2028Second, it’s unnecessary for children to have any major responsibilities to shoulder. Political, economic, social and family problems do not disturb them.

The particular decision that seems most important to me was the time I decided to major in literature instead of engineering. \\u2028I made this decision just after I finished 12th grade, when I was 18 years old. My father did not force me to do anything; he simply told me to do what I thought was best for me. My other relatives, however, thought that I was a fool and too immature to make a big decision for myself. But, after considering several issues and perspectives, I decided to enrol with a university that offered a literature major. I'm happy that I made this decision. I'm yet to finish the course, but throughout the last 3 years I have enjoyed studying literature and I am doing quite well academically. Making the decision was not easy, and I had to fight a lot with my inner self and then convince my mother. There was always the risk of picking the wrong option, and I knew that my parents would have complained if I hadn’t reached my academic potential. I still remember the dubious feelings I had at that time. Sometimes it seemed to me that I should abandon my passion and yield to my parents' wishes, but I knew that this was a decision that I had to make alone.

I believe this for the following reasons. \\u2028First, not being taught the skills of everyday living can limit a child’s ability to function at age appropriate levels. By expecting children to complete self-care tasks and help with household chores, parents equip children with the skills to function independently in the outside world. Isn’t this the main purpose of parenthood?\\u2028Second, doing chores gives a child the opportunity to give back to their parents for all their parents do for them. Children will feel more capable for having met their obligations and completed their tasks. By completing household tasks — though they may not always be a star student — they will begin to see themselves as important contributors to the family. This ingrained sense of self-worth will enable the child to begin to take care of themselves and learn skills that they will need as an adult.",

Employers love to have interns and volunteers because it allows them to “try out” a potential employee to see if they will fit into the culture of the organization. If you work hard, internships are an excellent opportunity to show your strengths as a potential candidate. Second, as well as representing an opportunity for an organization to scope you out, internships also enable you to develop a sense of workforce expectations.

They should get at least 60 minutes of physical activity each day, including vigorous activities that make them “huff and puff.” Parents should be good role models and have a positive attitude to being active.\\u2028Second, parents should strive to choose water as a drink rather than offering high sugar fruit juices. Water is the best way to quench your thirst and it doesn’t come with the added sugar found in fruit juices, soft drinks and the like. \\u2028Third, parents should reduce children’s snack intake and select healthier alternatives to help them meet their daily nutritional needs.

  "answer": "Personally, I would have to say that the steps through which I learned English were most effective. They might be worth sharing with you here.\\u2028First, it's important to say that I found interest to be the best teacher. I became interested in English long before I really started learning it — I watched a lot of English movies and listened to many English songs when I was little. Thanks to this, I had basic knowledge of the subject before I even began to consciously study it. \\u2028Later, when I started learning it in middle school, I made a conscious decision to do well in the subject. To enlarge my vocabulary, I memorized a hundred new words every day and learned movie dialogue by heart in my spare time. There were certainly some hurdles at the beginning — I found word pronunciation, for instance rather difficult — but I kept practicing until I could finally make it.\\u2028That's the way I learn a new subject — I find ways to enjoy it so it doesn’t feel like a chore.

  "answer": "There is no doubt in my mind that one day people will be predominately reading on eReaders and tablets. I believe this for the following reasons. \\u2028First, modern methods, such as eBooks, have made reading books more convenient, as they enable you to purchase reading material without even having to leave the house. Nowadays, anyone with an eReader, tablet, computer or smartphone is carrying around the world’s biggest bookstore, with literally millions of titles at their fingertips. People have become accustomed to filling in smaller and smaller breaks in their day with reading on portable devices.\\u2028Second, reading eBooks can improve the efficiency of studying as they have become great tools for students to acquire studying material. Products such as eReaders ease the load on their backpack as dictionaries, online help and textbooks can all be found on one handy device. Moreover, eBooks can contain audio, videos and animations, which can enhance the message that the author is trying to convey and appeal to students who may not learn most effectively via traditional methods",

  "answer": "Becoming a volunteer has plenty of advantages. Here are some. One main reason why students should volunteer is that helping others is mentally rewarding. Volunteering provably reduces stress. Experts report that when you focus on someone other than yourself, typical tension producing patterns are interrupted. It can bring you better moods and emotions, as you begin to feel more optimistic and joyful. \\u2028Second, volunteering strengthens communities. As a volunteer, you can help support families through volunteering to help children and the elderly. What's more, you can improve schools by tutoring other students or participating in afterschool programs. Likewise, through working with local non-profit agencies, volunteers can discover hidden talents that may change their view on self-worth.",

There are various scientific and historical documentaries that impart knowledge. They offer insight into different places and lifestyles that I’d otherwise have very limited exposure to. Documentaries can allow you to develop a more “well-rounded” base of knowledge, rather than specialize in one thing.\\u2028Besides, educational TV programs can also be fun and interesting.

  "answer": "It’s generally believed that God only bestows talents upon some individuals and that these people succeed with ease. But I cannot sympathize with this understanding, especially when it comes to sport. \\u2028The foremost reason for this is that a sportsperson can be successful primarily by working hard. In my opinion, the success of a sportsperson is 90 percent about sweat and 10 percent talent. Just as Kevin Durant said, “Hard work beats talent when talent fails to work hard.” Durant’s career is a testament to this adage. \\u2028Moreover, even the most talented sportsperson is unlikely to become a star without practice. Many young footballers with excellent gifts are hounded by sycophantic devotees, giving them a sense that they can simply drift to the top, buoyed by their innate brilliance. However, once they stopped training as hard, their careers stalled. As you can see, hard work is the most important quality in a sportsperson.",

You might think that scheduling your plans and hobbies is a simple productivity hack. In reality, knowing when you have free time also means knowing how you can best spend the limited time you have.\\u2028Second, through careful planning, you’ll get more free time. How many times has work silently crept into your free time? That won’t happen any more if you have made an inflexible prior arrangement.

  "answer": "Here are the pros and cons associated with the tourism industry. \\u2028On one hand, international tourism can promote economic development. A thriving tourism industry implies an increasing need for a variety of services. This consequently creates a large number of jobs, especially unskilled jobs. Once these jobs are created, employees will be able to accumulate a disposable income. This will further stimulate the country’s economic growth. \\u2028On the other hand, international tourism may result in the diminishment of cultural identity. One major change can be seen in the production of souvenirs. Once foreign tourists arrive in an area, the local people realize that money can be made by selling their crafts to visitors. Some designs may be changed to meet tourists’ demands. After a while, though, crafts which once had a spiritual or cultural significance will become simply moneymaking opportunities. ",

I feel this way for a number of reasons. \\u2028First, no matter what stage you are in your life, everyone must learn that their action will have consequences — school is no exception. Teachers need to be able to set boundaries in their classrooms. A classroom without boundaries and consequences does a great disservice to every student in that class because it fails to prepare them for the harsh realities of life. \\u2028Second, if you are a parent who believes that teachers should not be allowed to punish students, maybe you should consider home-schooling your child.

It is clear to me that the poor salaries of nurses do not accurately reflect their heavy workloads.   Secondly, nurses also have extensive educational requirements. They may need to achieve an education level ranging from a specialty diploma to a specialized graduate education. Sometimes **a nurse practitioner** has responsibilities similar to those of a doctor. So **her schooling** may involve between six to eight years of post-secondary education.

As everyone knows, the arrangement of a get-together with friends can be fraught with difficulty. Trying to schedule a dinner party, or even meeting for drinks in a bar, may take more than a dozen emails to coordinate. Most likely, we’ll end up with a date two months away — the earliest time everyone is available. This is never a problem with a surprise visit. \\u2028Second, compared to informed visits that are often mixed with hidden intentions, a surprise visit shows that a friend really wants to see me and is sincere about our relationship.

  "answer": "Nothing is simple when coming up with ways of strengthening and invigorating such a vast and complex institution as our educational system, but here are some basic ideas that might work. First, students should go beyond the textbook to study complex topics based on real-world issues. Project based classwork is more demanding than traditional book based instruction, where students only memorize facts from a single source. Through project based learning, students are still able to utilize original documents and data to master principles covered in traditional courses. The only difference is in application and, thus, depth of understanding.  \\u2028Second, education shouldn’t end when the bell rings. Modern schoolwork should involve parents, enabling students to learn more. Parents and other caregivers are a child's first teachers. They are the people who instill values that encourage school learning. By realizing the school's educational goals, the importance of high expectations for each child, and ways of assisting with homework and classroom lessons, parents can commit themselves to creating a better home environment for their child, an environment that is conducive to hard work and study.

We should remember that college education is a collaborative process that works best when students and instructors communicate freely in an exchange of ideas, information and perspectives. Second, everyone is born with the ability to think independently and come up with distinctive ideas. Those who are afraid of being different will just repeat what their instructors say.

Firstly, swimming is an excellent form of exercise, one that helps you stay mentally and physically healthy. Because it is performed in water, swimming is obviously low impact, so you can do it every day. \\u2028Second, swimming instills a number of transferable skills into those who partake. In competitive swimming, swimmers will learn self-motivation, goal setting and time management.

  "answer": "Emails have many advantages over the telephone. First, email allows me to prioritize issues, questions and **“to-dos**.” Emails fit around your schedule rather than vice versa. If I’m busy and my mother emails me, for instance, I can **flag it** and get back to it when I have time. Emails also **keep track of** themselves. Emails are a historical record of what happened and who said what. I have no “Previous Phone Calls” folder. But I can save an email message to figure out what was the last interaction I had with **so and so**.  Finally, email addresses are easier to remember. Phone numbers are an **arbitrary collection** of digits, but email addresses are usually some variation of “person@company.” I can remember hundreds of email addresses off the top of my head, but perhaps only two or three dozen phone numbers.***Notes：**1.

  "answer": "Personally, I think that students should plan their career before entering college. I feel this way for the following reasons. \\u2028First, the process should help you discover what you are really good at and enjoy doing. Identifying your interests as early as possible allows you to focus on the field of your choice and then you can get a better understanding of the relationship between study and future career. If you begin university with only a hazy picture of your future, you will waste a large amount of valuable time.\\u2028Second, once you discover your interests, you can set out to gain practical experience. The earlier you set out to plan your career, the more practical experience you may gain, such as taking internships.

If the movie is not that good, we revel in criticizing and mocking the movie and its flaws. \\u2028Second, details that we have missed can be filled in. When we are focusing on something else that we find interesting, we might miss some aspects of the movie. We may even sometimes begin to misunderstand the plot.

  "answer": "Historical facts can be a useful way of contextualizing historical events and memorizing them should be encouraged to some extent. However, this should never be prioritized over gleaning a deeper understanding of a topic. Students should have a base knowledge about their country and their community affiliations. But history’s relevance lies not just in knowing historical fact but being able to effectively analyse cause and effect, progress and decline and historical significance. They still have to know what happened, but they also have to be able to put it into a larger context of what was happening at the time, why it was happening and what relevance it has to the present day.\\u2028Thinking like a historian, according to Trofanenko, entails studying primary source documents, thinking about the historical context, weighing the evidence and then making an argument. That helps students develop a historical consciousness — the ability to ask why a particular historical narrative or a historical concept has become accepted . When taught incorrectly, history is often used as a way to instill nationalism, patriotism and the blind commitment to a country. This becomes particularly strong when there's a threat against the nation, like in the United States after Sept. 11. But that often blinds everyone to unsavory historical events that have happened in the past. That's why it's important to foster a healthy atmosphere of skepticism in students instead of training a generation of expert date-learning test takers. ",

General knowledge is superior to expertise in the following ways. First, let’s discuss the downsides of being an expert. Not only does lacking general knowledge make you a boring conversationalist, but it also prevents you from connecting with others through your work as well. Being more of a generalist makes it possible to take something personal and share it with others in a way they not only understand but can appreciate. Second, it’s more fun to be the jack of all trades than the master of one. The generalist maximizes his number of peak experiences in life and learns to enjoy the pursuit of excellence unrelated to material gain, all while finding the few things he is truly uniquely suited to dominate. Only the curious generalist consistently measures improvement in quantum leaps.",

When I am sick or unable to attend class, I can get notes from members of my study group.\\u2028Second, group work enables me to draw on collective knowledge.

Very quickly, if a child isn’t exposed to the correct sounds by the time their linguistic window closes, their ability to learn a second language begins to diminish. \\u2028Moreover, studies have shown that the ability to command the English language is indirectly proportional to the age of immigrants. Those who arrive on American soil before the age of seven perform as well academically as their native peers. Performance steadily declines as the age of the immigrant increases.\\u2028Finally, we normally speak with an accent when we learn a foreign language after our linguistic window closes. If you learn another language while you master your native tongue, it is unlikely that you will speak with a distinguishable accent. ",

It also allows online scams to flourish, and, if you're not careful about the information you reveal, you can leave yourself open to identity theft. Furthermore, it’s important to bear in mind that networking online can be addictive. If you allow them, social networking sites can completely consume your life.

Junk food leads to a lot of health problems like decayed teeth, obesity, high blood pressure, etc. That's horrible. What's more, eating too much junk food will have a negative effect on study.

A person who enjoys certain television shows might wear shirts reflecting those interests with slogans or other ornamentations, displaying their preferences for the world to see. It is common, for instance, to see a Real Madrid fan sporting the badge. \\u2028These are the reasons why I believe outfits can and should reveal one's personality.",

I feel this way for the following reasons.\\u2028Firstly, it must be noted that no one wants to work in a toxic environment. Hence, it’s of great importance for any organization to create and maintain a friendly environment in which employees can work happily, cordially and efficiently, while simultaneously balancing the demands of both work and life. The presence of friendly co-workers is a surefire way to achieve this. \\u2028Secondly, friendly co-workers will lead to a successful business. Friendly co-workers generate a higher engagement in the work. Per contra, distracted co-workers can destroy your business.

  "answer": "In most cases, the best teachers we have in our lives are our parents. Compared to teachers, parents are generally more involved in the development and education of children. I feel this way for the following reasons. \\u2028First, teachers cannot replace parents in the shaping of a child’s character, life and future. Teachers are permitted to teach some given subjects in the classroom, but parents teach kids everything. They teach kids how to walk, to speak and to have good manners before they enter “the real world.” Parents devote all their time and energy to their own children, while one-to-one communication is usually lacking with teachers.\\u2028Second, parents teach less by telling children what they should or should not do, but more by example. A father who wakes up late will never be able to teach his children to wake up early. Research on marriage and divorce, for example, has shown that children with divorced parents are very likely to have broken marriages themselves. Parents teach even when they don’t know it. ",

Sure, whether you actually summit is up to you. But that doesn’t mean you climb alone. Ideally, you’ll have a crew of solid dudes with you — I have tight bonds with the three guys I’ve mountaineered with. The sharing of life-threatening experiences forges strong ties. You can travel farther and accomplish more than you think, so climbing is an excellent way of challenging yourself and realizing your full potential. Uphill trails only leave two choices: reach the top or turn around. Reaching the top requires the perseverance to keep putting one foot in front of the other.

The predominant reason for this is that camping is one of the best ways to connect and bond with other people. If a hectic study schedule is leaving students with little or no time for their classmates, an outdoor camping night is the perfect answer. With no television, computers or cell phones to serve as distractions, activities such as fishing, cooking and setting up camp will have everyone working and spending some quality time together. Add some fun activities like camping games and bonfires, and everyone is sure to have a blast.\\u2028In addition, an outdoor camping night does not require much prior planning.

  "answer": "No, I don’t think it’s a good idea to give children money for doing housework. Here’s why. \\u2028First, as part of the family, kids are responsible for contributing to the wellbeing of the household. Chores, such as doing dishes and folding laundry, are necessary to keep the family going. Since parents and children both live in the house, they should do household tasks together. Besides, these tasks benefit the kids themselves. They should not, therefore, be rewarded with money.\\u2028Second, the family serves as a sort of miniature model of the real world. We love and care for each other, without expecting something in return. This means kids may have to take out the trash when dad works late, or help with dinner if a client calls while mother is cooking. Making this concept an expected and normal part of life will make it easier for children when they’re grown and have families of their own.",

How can we, as individuals, combat this problem? When shopping for a new or used vehicle (or even renting a vehicle), choose the cleanest, most fuel-efficient vehicle that meets your needs. With a wide range of clean, fuel-efficient vehicles available today, it’s easier than ever to go green — for the environment, and for your wallet. Also, you can try to walk instead of using vehicles in everyday life. As for natural resource depletion, we can buy and use less stuff. This is the best way to conserve natural resources. For example, it takes one ton of raw materials from the earth to make one laptop computer! We can also pay special attention to reducing the amount of non-renewable resources we use.

Whether to cover living and academic expenses or simply to get hold of a bit of spending money, working a part-time job is a good idea for most students. \\u2028Second, money is not the only thing you can gain from part-time work.

  "answer": "To some extent, I believe that it is important to preserve old buildings. I feel this way for the following reasons. \\u2028Most importantly, to a degree that may surprise cynics, old buildings can offer opportunities for a community's future. Old buildings attract tourists, who boost the local economy. The success of America's downtown revivals, for instance, exemplifies the economic potential of old buildings. Whether the feeling is patriotic, homey, warm, or reassuring, older architecture tends to fit the bill. Old buildings also serve as reminders of a city's culture and complexity. Through visiting historic buildings, whether related to something famous or recognizably dramatic, tourists and long-time residents alike are able to witness the aesthetic and cultural history of an area. Just as banks prefer to build stately, old-fashioned facades, even when located in commercial malls, a city needs old buildings to maintain a sense of permanency and heritage.\\u2028In addition, building preservation is good for the environment. Preserving a building is the ultimate form of recycling, as it keeps construction materials out of landfill. Approximately 20% of the solid waste stream is construction waste. Additionally, many traditional building practices in historic buildings are “green.” Covered porches reduce heat gain during the summer, and thick walls, attics and cellars help keep interior temperatures. These are the reasons why old buildings should be preserved. ",

Gifts play a key role in this as they allow the Chinese people to not only demonstrate their respect to elders and superiors, but also to show their commitment to maintaining close relationships with family and friends.\\u2028Gifts also play an important role when building new relationship networks with other business people. At work, gifts can be given at formal meetings with government officials, as well as clients and prospective business partners. Outside of work, gifts are given on a wide variety of different occasions including holidays, birthdays and special events. While it’s true that a gift is just a gift, what is more important to the Chinese is the meaning behind the gift — that is your respect, commitment, devotion and so on.

  "title": "Do you believe students should begin learning how to use computers in primary school?",
  "answer": "I agree with this statement for a number of reasons. \\u2028First, it is educationally vital for a country. We live in a digital world where computer programs underlie everything from business, aviation and medicine, to name several disciplines. A lack of computing in schools will put a country's position as a world leader in computer gaming, for instance, at risk.\\u2028Second, computer science involves a new way of thinking about problem-solving; it's called computational thinking, and it's about understanding the difference between human and artificial intelligence, as well as about thinking recursively. If kids don't have a deeper understanding of computing, they will grow up as passive consumers of inaccessible devices and services. Third, if taught properly, students can rapidly transfer the principles of computer science to other areas.",

  "answer": "Personally, I would choose to teach children about environmental awareness because once the children have understood the importance of environmental protection, they will stay engaged and inspire people around them to do so as well.\\u2028For instance, when I was in elementary school, my teacher once told us that when we used plastic bags or bottles for our food and drink, we were in fact murdering animals and plants in the forests and coastal waters because that is where all unrecyclable trash is disposed. After hearing that, my classmates and I all became very conscious about using plastic containers and, to this day, we still barely use any plastic bags and bottles in our household.",

  "answer": "As far as I am concerned, dance club is the last club you should miss. I would love to join dance club for the following reasons. First, in dance club, teamwork becomes the mantra. It’s not about individual talent; it’s about what the team can do as a whole. An impressive solo turn combination is cool, but when an entire team does it in perfect unison, it’s amazing.\\u2028Second, the skills developed in dance club will help me for the rest of my life. Being part of a dance team will teach me discipline, time management and how to take constructive criticism — skills that will make me a better dancer and a better person. These are the reasons why I can’t wait to join a dance society at university. ",

  "answer": "I think that in ten years the distinguishing difference from today's life will lie in smartphones, both in their hardware and software. The hardware interface will enable the smartphone to see and hear what we do. It will thus be capable of listening to our commands and gathering contextual input. At the same time, it will also provide visual and auditory feedback. The software interface is what will make these systems much more interesting. Phones will essentially become virtual assistants — always on, always listening and always able to offer advice. They will provide quick notifications and connect you to requested information. They will be able to make a call, turn down the target temperature in the house and order gifts for friends.",

  "answer": "An event that recently captured my attention was the surge in the prices of new homes in China’s most developed cities over the past 12 months. Shenzhen led the pack with a 52 percent rise over the past year, triggering fears that the property market was overheating. Meanwhile, smaller cities have been suffering from oversupply, with property investment growth falling to one percent last year, down from 10.5 per cent in 2014. Although the Chinese government has long been adamant about transforming the nation from an investment focused economy to a consumption driven, technologically advanced, knowledge based one, the current state of housing prices reflects the precise opposite. That is why the change in housing prices is becoming a crucial problem. Now, local governments in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Guangzhou are imposing strict measures to rein in skyrocketing home prices in order to cool the overheated market.",

  "answer": "I believe that students should take a gap year to consider their motives. The growing trend of taking a year off between high school and college is a positive one if approached correctly.The primary benefit of taking a gap year is that students will be more energetic upon their return. Taking a break from the academic grind allows for new, different but equally important experiences. They can step off the academic treadmill after high school and work, travel, volunteer or explore other interests. Chances are, students will be better prepared and more excited for whatever they return to after the year off.\\u2028Second, a gap year is a great opportunity to get global experience. There are gap year programs everywhere, so take a risk and try something exotic. Gap years can serve as the perfect opportunity for one to figure out who they are, what they like and how they react to new environments.",

The following are the two main study habits employed by me.\\u2028First, it is important to start with the most difficult subject. As my most difficult assignment or subject will require the most effort and mental energy, I will start with it first. Trust me, once you’ve completed the most difficult work, it will be much easier to complete the rest of your work. Believe it or not, starting with the most difficult subject will greatly improve the effectiveness of your study sessions and my academic performance.\\u2028Second, I always review my notes before starting an assignment. Before I can review my notes, I must first have notes to review, so always make sure to take good notes in class. Before I start each study session, and before I start a particular assignment, I review my notes thoroughly to make sure I know how to complete the assignment correctly. Reviewing my notes before each study session helps me remember important subject matter learned during the day, and ensures that my studying is targeted and effective. ",

  "answer": "In general, knowledge gained from books has a wider range than that gained from experience. Unlike the experience of an individual that is limited by the range of that person, books seem to have almost no limitation. If  you have acquired basic reading skills, infinite knowledge is at your fingertips, with nearly no expense at all.  \\u2028On the other hand, knowledge gained from experience is **much deeper and more comprehensive** than that gained from books. We have to gain the knowledge by our own experience, and even some knowledge that is contained in books usually needs **further comprehension**, mainly through experience.   \\u2028Therefore, I think whether one source is more important than the other **depends on circumstance**. It's hard to imagine having a good understanding of history without reading books. On the other hand, when we try to learn to swim, we have to jump into the water and then gain the knowledge with experience. Both are important.***Notes：**1.

When it comes to being a good neighbor, low noise levels and not throwing late-night parties are also necessary characteristics.  Second, a good neighbor should be there to **count on**. For example, when a burglar broke into my house when I was home alone, it was my friendly neighbor who alerted the police in time and informed us immediately. This kind of **mutual assistance** can improve mutual understanding within the neighborhood, which is beneficial for social interaction.***Notes：**1.

But actually, if you focus your attention and efforts less on the results you’re hoping for and more on the processes and techniques you use, you will learn faster, become more successful, and be happier with the outcome.\\u2028One benefit on focusing on the process is that it lets you enjoy the task more. Life is lived in the present, not the future, and happiness is a process, not a place. Focusing on process will let you engage more deeply with the present and experience it more fully, which will help you learn faster and experience life more completely.\\u2028A focus on the present also eliminates the noise of external factors. Success can follow a flawed effort and failure can follow a flawless effort. In those cases, judging performance by outcome will reinforce the wrong techniques. You’ll achieve mastery of a new skill more quickly if you can learn to detect those cases and reinforce the correct processes whether or not they happen to lead to the desired outcome. ",

Independence increases our feelings of self-efficacy — the idea that we're generally flexible and competent and can handle what life throws at us.\\u2028Second, depending on others sometimes can cause trouble. Two heads may be better than one, but only when we can competently discuss our different perspectives. If one person in the team has flawed information or is incompetent, the outcome can be negative and perhaps you’ll regret involving them in the first place.

First is the exposure to a more **diverse** group of people. People in big cities tend to meet and get to know people of different races, religions and social classes. This is less true in a small town. Thus, living in a city prepares children for life in a diverse society.In addition, children growing up in the city typically have more opportunities when it comes to education. Most cities offer a variety of **magnet**, **charter**, private and public schools, which have to be competitive with one another (in price and quality) to keep their doors open.Lastly, cities offer better social support services, such as libraries and recreation centers.

Since many college dormitories are very small, collecting masses of college textbooks can be a burden. Renting a textbook enables you to keep small amounts of books at a time. Ship the books back to the retailer for little to no shipping cost and save much needed storage space.\\u2028Second, through renting textbooks you will save lots of money. Since textbooks are commonly rented by the semester, quarter or holiday, the price of a rented book is commonly 80 percent less than that of a new one.

When applying for job openings in various competitive fields, candidates who have a degree hold the advantage over those without. Businesses hold degrees in such high regard because they also teach respect and perceptiveness, which come with the maturity associated with attending college.",

  "answer": "I prefer essay based exams for the following reasons. \\u2028First, essays can test higher level cognitive skills than objective exams. An essay requires students to apply knowledge, analyze data, synthesize and finally draw conclusions. This better reflects the course objective, which aims to teach students how to turn facts into understanding. \\u2028Second, students study more efficiently in preparing for an essay based test. Instead of spending time on the tedious memorization of material, essay takers are able to generalize and conceptualize the material, using facts as supporting information rather than as ends unto themselves. Essay based tests help students retain the core concepts of a course.",

Perhaps this **very** technique is what draws one into the painting; the fulfillment of seeing all angles of the **spectrum of life** and, in turn, reaching a deeper understanding of how all living things are tied together. Also, Van Gogh's painting of sunflowers has altered mankind's perspective of art and life. The painting **captivates the mind** and leaves you astounded by its simplistic beauty. The flowing wilted stems and the burst of lovely yellow draw one's attention to the painting, without disrupting the balance of the piece. The piece has been frequently duplicated, but they never reach the pure power of Van Gogh’s original. ***Notes：**1.

The magnitude of these areas and the complexity of their protection makes conservation a logistical nightmare, and a task way beyond the capabilities of the private sector. \\u2028Second, funds shouldn’t simply be put towards obvious methods of conservation, they can also be put towards maintaining laws which protect endangered animals.

Students will be less likely to cheat if they believe that their school values real mastery of a subject, as opposed to an overemphasis on rote memorization. I believe schools should use multiple measures of testing a student’s capabilities. Moreover, among all the ways teachers could discourage cheating, the best one is creating a climate of caring in classrooms, making students believe they belong in classrooms and really feel supported by their teachers.

Take swimmer Liz Johnson, who is a Paralympic gold medalist, for example. She was born with cerebral palsy, but she started to swim when she was only three. Through endless repetition and practice, the functioning side of her brain adapted to make both sides of her body operate effectively in the water and she became champion!

  "title": "Describe the historical event that you are most interested in. Explain why you are interested in it. ",
  "answer": "I find the American Civil War very interesting for a number of reasons. First, the event marked the first true opportunity to challenge the deeply entrenched racial prejudices of the time, both in the North and the South. The service of black soldiers made many people start to rethink whether or not their preconceived notions regarding the inferiority of black people were correct. Even Abraham Lincoln, who had been hitherto opposed to black voting, came to acknowledge that blacks should be granted the vote. \\u2028I am also fascinated by the sheer scale of the conflict. The Civil War was responsible for more American casualties than any other war, and I cannot begin to fathom the heartbreak, anger and bitterness that it caused. It was the first time that the innovation of embalming was created, which meant that the bodies could be received by their families for their last rites.",

  "title": "Do you prefer outdoor or indoor games?",
  "answer": "It is better for all of us, especially children, to play games outdoors. Many studies tell us why indoor play is **detrimental to** children’s growth. Outdoors, a child learns on multiple levels with each new adventure. Through creating imaginary castles, lands and creatures, the brain develops at a much faster rate than it does if you’re stuck indoors. There are numerous other positive effects of outdoor play. When children play outdoors, not only do they perform better academically, but they are also more fun to be around. Everyone wants to play with the kid with an active imagination! Consequently, children will be much happier because, if they play outdoors, they’re more likely to be smart and have lots of friends. All of this comes from just playing outside; you can **bake many loaves in the same oven**. There are even more physical advantages of outdoor play than mental ones. Obviously, if a child is playing outside he/she will be way more active than the child that stays indoors. The great thing about this is that it can have **long-lasting effects**. **Years down the road**, the child will still be more active and less likely to be overweight. ***Notes：**1.

When they are loving, they are consciously sharing their thoughts and feelings; they are tenderly touching and holding their child with care. They create quality time where they look into their child's eyes and connect with their soul. They create an environment that is safe from any emotional, mental or physical harm. They are positive role models, and being a positive role model is more effective than specific disciplinary measures. Children learn through observation and often mimic the behavior of their parents. When they watch their parents arguing and losing control, they feel less safe. They might try to resolve conflicts by fighting and arguing, just like their parents do. If parents are loving, then their children are likely to follow suit. ",

  "answer": "By far the most important factor determining the standard of education in a county is the quality of teaching. We have never seen an education system that’s bereft of talented educators achieve or sustain world-class status. It’s simply impossible. Here are two defining characteristics common to all good teachers. \\u2028First, it is important to bear in mind that, though teacher quality is the key, just recruiting better teachers won’t do it.  In fact, it is more important for a school to exhibit inspiring and intelligent leadership. Teachers are shaped by the school’s ethos and culture, and the school’s ethos and culture are formed by the leadership department. Governing bodies need to be stronger in comparing the ethos, culture and leadership of their schools against the tenacious consistency of the best schools who succeed against the odds. If some schools manage it, all schools should be capable of replicating it. \\u2028Second, subject curricula must be sequenced coherently. Teaching quality cannot be separated from the curriculum. The empirical success of careful sequences of content should make us rethink how we order what we teach. Given the autonomy and freedom schools are granted to innovate in the curriculum, improvements should be made. ",

New thoughts always expand our minds, as we begin to rediscover the magic of life. We begin to see the world differently and we find new creative solutions because of it. No doubt, at times, this resolution will require discipline. The best ones always do. Secondly, reading the same book several times helps me better discern good ideas from bad ideas. One thing’s for sure, there are a lot of different approaches to life and the problems we face. Reading books provides the opportunity to better discern what has worked in the past and what has not. This becomes clearer with every read. \\u2028Last, it increases my reading speed. Just like any skill in life, our reading improves with practice.

A restauranteur worries about everything that goes on in the restaurant, from staff arguments to finding good cooks. A good restaurant owner knows how to handle the stress of the job and refuses to let it consume him or her.\\u2028Second, a restaurant is a gathering place, so many owners form close relationships with their customers and employees.

Most students who have automobiles tend to drive themselves and others to practicums. This suddenly makes cars and, thus, parking spaces, an indispensable asset to every class. If they can park their cars on the university’s parking lot, it will save a whole lot of time. This should improve overall academic performances.

Here are some crucial things to look out for when considering joining a new company. First, we need to find a company that encourages **transparent and open communication**. **In essence**, an open form of communication addresses the employee's need to feel what they have to say has value.

Technology is evolving so rapidly that programs organizations commonly used ten years ago could be **obsolete** today. Finally, there has to be some sort of balance between work and personal life. When employees fulfill their various needs and goals in life — such as those of family, friends, spiritual pursuits, self-growth, etc. — they then feel more confident about themselves and perform their best at work. Apart from that, employees that are exposed to more experiences in life outside of work can use what they’ve gained and apply that to their work. This should also be encouraged in any positive working environment. ***Notes：**transparent and open communication**：透明的，公开的沟通**In essence**：本质上，大体上**affiliated with**：有紧密关系的**keep abreast with**：齐头并进**obsolete**：过时的***",

  "answer": "I like to work with children. Here’s why. \\u2028First, working with children enables me to expand my knowledge. Children are, by nature, very curious. With all the questions they ask, I constantly find myself looking for answers in books and on the internet. This can only benefit my personal development. \\u2028Second, through caring for the children of others I am able to express my love for children. Working with the children of others allows me to have a positive impact on the children.\\u2028Finally, when people work with children, they help those children develop important traits like honesty and discipline, as well as social traits that will help them live fuller lives and make friends. People who work with children also tend to help kids develop learning skills.",

I still have vivid memories of my sister's little boy who would walk in from the bathroom, pants around his ankles, shouting, “someone come and wipe my bum right now!” Of course, the teachers will be there to help, but with lots of kids in the class, the child should learn this essential skill fast!

There are several reasons why I feel this way. \\u2028First, diverse friendship groups can increase my self-awareness and acceptance of others. Being around those who think differently from us helps us to understand ourselves better. We become more conscious, which keeps us from the trap of dogmatism and ignorance. \\u2028Second, making friends with those who don’t share my outlook changes my perceptions. People who are different challenge our way of thinking. Being with them will keep us aware that there are many different perspectives.

When I get good team members and make friends with those people, I will be more satisfied than if I am simply victorious.

There’s something about a good story that reveals truth in ways that nonfiction cannot. A good story makes us experience truth. Although nonfiction is great for conveying information, fiction can make that same information sink into our bones in powerful ways.\\u2028Secondly, fiction, like any good art form, has a unique ability to display beauty. The right combination of words, a powerful metaphor, a well described scene — each of these uses the written word to display beauty in ways that no other art form can. And, although nonfiction has the same ability to manifest beauty through the written word, there’s something in the beauty of narrative that’s impossible to capture in any other medium.",

  "title": "Talk about a way in which your personality has changed since you were a child.",
  "answer": "My previous personality can be described in the following way: a little reserved and introverted. When someone is an introvert, they get more energy from being alone or socializing in small groups. They might prefer to build deep relationships with only a few people rather than meeting a lot of new people all of the time. They might feel stressed or overwhelmed in a big city or a new environment because they encounter new sounds, people and sights around them. They tend to develop new ideas in their mind instead of immediately voicing the idea.\\u2028Current personality: ambivert. \\\"Ambivert\\\" is a term used to describe someone who can move between \\\"introvert\\\" and \\\"extrovert\\\" with ease. Someone might be an \\\"ambivert\\\" if they are social and outgoing in professional situations (extrovert), but they might prefer to socialize in small, intimate groups and to spend time alone in their personal life (introvert).\\u2028What prompted this change: my first job. As soon as I started my first job in New York, I got to know different types of people and was thrust into a team environment. This meant that I needed to make the effort to come out of my shell in order to communicate better. I am deeply grateful for that experience. ",

I learned more Japanese, and more about Japanese people, in a month of traveling than I did in an entire year of studying. There’s always going to be people who hide from actually doing amazing things because they’re too busy staying in their comfort zone. There’s really no method to learn quite like knowing that your life depends on it. After doing this year abroad, I’ve even realized that it’s perfectly reasonable to assume that you can gain daily life fluency (i.e. being capable of making friends, working, ordering food, going out, etc.) in any language within a year or two of living in that country. Of course, one has to keep in mind the diminishing returns of trying to gain that last 5% of fluency.

Sometimes friends will try to make plans with you and you have no reason to decline except for the fact that you just want to be alone that day. It can be difficult to carve out hours of alone time just to keep your sanity while trying to keep your relationships healthy and happy, too.\\u2028Moreover, alone time is usually the most productive time. Let’s say you’re always working on a project — perhaps something artistic — and you start to get antsy if you haven’t been able to work on it for a few days. A good album, book or television show can keep your attention far longer than any party, club or bar.\\u2028Time spent alone enables you to feel more relaxed without many commitments. Weekends in which you have no plans, no responsibilities and nowhere at all to be can often rank as the most memorable ones. A full day by yourself can be more rewarding than a day spent in the company of others. ",

Everyone gets the same amount of time each day, so it’s therefore important to make the most of your free time. Time management leads to higher productivity and a life of greater discipline. Time management will improve every aspect of your life. \\u2028Secondly, if we plan specific things that we actually want to do, rather than procrastinating, surfing the web or watching TV, we can spend our time on more fulfilling activities, such as sharing experiences with friends.

Here’s why. \\u2028Firstly, many children are under acute pressure to fulfill their parents' dream of gaining a place at the \\\"right\\\" school rather than making their own choices. This trend has surged drastically in recent years. What's more, children are now required to attend a copious amount of extracurricular activities, such as drawing, swimming, singing, dancing, etc. This leaves children with less time to play. Secondly, in this progressive era, people need to learn more knowledge and skills in order to get a more favorable job position in the future. So, parents may have to focus more on their children to avoid something which may distract them from their studies. In some cases, parents want their children to  achieve more in their lives than other children. Especially in Asia, family expectations are very high.

  "answer": "I believe students benefit more from classes with a small number of students. I feel this way for the following reasons. \\u2028Firstly, asking questions is an important part of the learning process, as it demonstrates active engagement with course material. When you are in a lecture style class at a large university with hundreds of other students, it can be intimidating to raise your hand to ask questions. When you are in a small class, asking questions is often encouraged and considered an important part of the classroom experience. If you don't understand something, you can ask for clarification promptly, instead of having to wait until after class or for office hours, which is often required in a large class.\\u2028Secondly, when students are in small classes, they are more likely to connect with one another. Striking up conversations before class, discussing assignments after class and forming study groups are commonplace when you share a class with a small group of peers. These connections not only make courses more enjoyable, but they can also lighten workloads if students strategically plan to divide and conquer some course tasks, like outlining textbook chapters or working on group projects. Connecting with other students can also lead to friendship, which can be a rich part of the college experience.",

  "answer": "I believe parents should guide their children when choosing between universities. \\u2028I believe this primarily because parents should be able to direct their children toward their future. Parents have given birth to the child and probably sacrificed a lot for them. Without the parents, the child wouldn't even be alive. It is essential for parents to have a say in their child's future or the child could become disobedient and forget their parents. They'll start to think that their parents don't even have any power over them. The child will become spoiled and disrespectful. Also, it is likely that the parents have gone through similar — if not the same — scenarios during their lives. They'll be able to guide their children this way. According to me, a parent is somebody who gave you support and really cares for you. Parents will help you in your difficult times and are always there for you. A parent is very precious for every human being. Parents will guide you to the right path. Never ignore your parent; those who do really don't deserve this world. Never let them down, because whatever decision your parents make is for your own good. Love your parents, and care for them the way they care for you.\\u2028A parent has the life experience, wisdom and knowledge that a child does not have, so why wouldn't a parent be an important contributor to their child's future? Yes, you want your child to have focus and clarity on future goals, but it's a parents' job to lead the way. ",

  "answer": "Personally speaking, I prefer to study outside the classroom. I feel this way for the following reasons. First of all, outside learning exposes students to new opportunities. Museums, galleries, zoos and farms can be of great interest to students, acting as places in which we can find out how things are made and maybe even engage in some interactive learning. Through creating a memorable experience, knowledge is more likely to take root. Moreover, learning outside the classroom fosters the use of “systems thinking.” As a mini-ecosystem, the outdoor classroom emphasizes the interconnectedness of all things. Through exposure to the intricate web of life, we come to understand that complex natural and societal systems often require holistic rather than linear solutions.\\u2028Third, it blurs the boundaries between academic learning and creative play. When a teacher asks who wants to go outside, every hand raises. By preserving a person’s innate sense of curiosity and wonder, outside learning promotes active engagement. Through showing that learning can be fun, members of the class become lifelong learners. ",

Moreover, if I buy a gift based on my tastes, I might end up offending my friend. This is especially true when it comes to foreign friends.

If you end up choosing a major in college when you first enter school and continue with that major throughout your time at university, you are missing out on exciting opportunities to discover new passions. Continuing with this theme, students who find themselves obtaining two college majors or a variety of minors tend to be more employable than those who take vocational subjects. \\u2028The second reason is that not all students arriving at college know exactly what they want to major in or what they want to do later in life. But, once students begin taking classes, they find that other courses or career paths may be right for them.

The amount of money received will always be finite, but human greed is insatiable. Rather than frivolously spending money to satisfy some animalistic desires, wiser people tend to spend money on practical things such as setting up a fund for charity or helping those who are in urgent need of food and sanitation.\\u2028Second, people who spend such money on purely pleasurable pursuits tend to believe that money can buy happiness.

There are several reasons why people have turned away from traditional Chinese fashion.\\u2028The earliest instances of Chinese people wearing Western clothes probably date back to the colonial era. But at that time, only those of high status could wear these new fabrics, as imports were reserved for those who could afford them. Western clothes were once seen as status symbols, but the changing economic landscape has made them available to the masses. \\u2028Moreover, people in mainland China stopped wearing traditional clothing because of the Cultural Revolution.

His clothing therefore discloses both a laidback personality and an alternative occupation.\\u2028What's more, although clothing choice is subject to fashion trends, it still indicates certain personality traits. Someone who follows trends often enjoys standing out in a crowd, because some new fashion trends can be daring or unusual. Thus, one who subscribes to an outlandish fad is more likely to be a bold and adventurous person.",

  "answer": "We may sometimes forget what it was like to live in a pre-Internet age. Our lives have changed dramatically since the dawn of the Internet. Here’s how. First, the Internet liberates us to connect with people from all corners of the globe with ease. Social networks like Facebook and Twitter allow us to connect with people who, in a pre-Internet age, we might not have even known about. Facebook acts as a middle man, facilitating conversation with new friends and solidifying existing relationships. What’s more, the way we consume information has changed drastically too, as news and information can be accessed instantly from anywhere in the world. This not only means that we can get information quicker, but also that traditional information sources like newspapers have been forced to adapt to a new role, adding context rather than news. Moreover, media piracy and social networking sites have changed our legal systems, making so-called super injunctions almost pointless and intellectual property laws seem equally toothless.",

  "answer": "I prefer essay questions for the following reasons. \\u2028Firstly, essay based examinations are best suited for testing higher-level learning, and they thus require careful preparation and scoring. By nature, they give students a longer time to think, organize and compose their answers. Multiple choice tests, conversely, do not offer students the chance to do so, the thoughts just come in a flash.\\u2028Moreover, essay questions, when scored properly, can enhance learning. Teachers score essay exams using either a holistic or analytic approach. Teachers’ comments on their students’ papers will enhance learning and reinforce what students know and need to learn. Because objective tests are scored right or wrong, the student does not benefit from feedback. ",

  "answer": "Today I’d like to talk about the white-flag dolphin. Once ranked the second most endangered species in China, the white-flag dolphin is now totally extinct. White-flag dolphins generally lived in freshwater and had poor eyesight. They had silver-gray skin, which is different from their sea-based counterparts, who usually have light blue skin.\\u2028According to a documentary I saw years ago, the Yangtze River used to be inhabited by thousands of white-flag dolphins. However, due to human population growth along the Yangtze River and the increasing pollution levels associated with this, the species’ population began to decline. Tragically, people often found their corpses washed up on the river bank. After watching this documentary, I realized the importance of protecting the creatures from extinction.\\u2028Unfortunately for these creatures, despite the fact that residents along the river respect them as the “Goddesses of the Yangtze” and began to take some measures to protect them, the species perished. Perhaps this is because most of the people in my country lack awareness. \\u2028Nowadays, many people in my country, especially those who are environmentally conscious, mourn over the loss of this amazing species, me included.

Students should take advantage of this opportunity and explore all facets of modern life, not just science and math. \\u2028Secondly, in an ideal world, everyone should maintain a balanced lifestyle, with elements of art and music woven into their daily lives.

He was perhaps the most diversely talented person to have ever lived. His innovations in the field of painting influenced the course of Italian art for more than a century after his death.\\u2028Second, Mona Lisa's famous smile is very mysterious which makes me curious about it.

Here’s why.\\u2028First of all, books are the bridges of thinking between different generations and cultures. Books cover a huge range of knowledge that has been accumulated throughout the history of humanity. Experience, however, only covers the wisdom one has accumulated during their life.\\u2028Besides, by reading books, one can acquire maximum knowledge in minimum time. For example, text books are collections of experiences that have been summarized and categorized into concrete words in a systematic layout. They do not only teach people how to avoid mistakes and dangers, but also instruct them to do the right thing.",

Part-time jobs provide students with precious chances to experience the daily life of their dream jobs.

I feel this way for the following reasons. \\u2028First, for the university, it is more important to think about the prevention of cheating than the punishment of it. Instances of cheating mean that the university should do more to shape the values of students. They cheat because they believe that only grades and test scores are valued in school, not mastery of the subject. This causes them to devalue the education they’re receiving. Evidently, it is obvious that asking students to leave school cannot eliminate the problem.\\u2028Second, there are some better ways to deal with this problem. For instance, the university may allow students to correct the mistake themselves, because university is the place where independence is fostered. Schools can also prevent cheating by setting up an Internet firewall so students can’t exchange instant messages that might contain exam answers.",

  "answer": "Young people find real-world solutions when they learn from their real lives, not from their textbooks. I believe we learn more outside the classroom than we do inside. I feel this way for the following reasons. \\u2028First, schools teach basic knowledge, such as facts and figures, but they do not tell you who you are and what you’re passionate about. A lot of self-realization and personal growth happens outside the classroom. These lessons can't be learned in hushed college lecture halls or busy college lab rooms — they’re learned through real experiences that teach us who we are and who we want to be.\\u2028Second, we have to practice outside of the classroom. You can learn grammar and words and sentences from your English book, but you can't speak fluent English without extra-curricular practice. That's why we should participate in more hands-on experiences rather than reading textbooks. ",

  "answer": "The best way to learn a new subject is to study small segments in great depth. The benefits of this method are as follows. \\u2028First, I believe that the studying of a subject requires a profound understanding of each part of the subject. An individual cannot learn geometry, for example, without a pre-existing understanding of the simplest notions, such as angles, lines, etc. Once a student becomes well-versed in geometry's basic principles, they can then go on to increase their knowledge by learning more complex topics such as analytical geometry or trigonometry. Obtaining any skill also requires practice. Before a person becomes a driver, for instance, he has to practice a lot. \\u2028As you can see, learning any skill requires an understanding of little pieces of a whole subject. Only through combining these pieces can a person gain a deep understanding or even expertise. ",

  "answer": "I would love to one day become an architect. The job appeals to me in the following ways. \\u2028First, to be an architect is to think differently from those around you and to be able to have a profound and concrete influence on the future. Architects are required to simultaneously address the multiple concerns of the business, the users, the evolving state of technology and the continuous need for innovation at lower costs, all while providing more robust and more reliable solutions. \\u2028Second, architecture is a lifestyle, not a job. You can be your own firm of one and still be a viable service provider on projects of almost any size. You can enter contests and win commissions for major projects by yourself.

I find residences with strict rules more appealing than those which lack regulations. I feel this way for the following reasons.\\u2028First, strict residence rules are instated with the main purpose of protecting residents. Since every student is responsible for their safety and security in the residence community, they are required to obey the rules regarding entrance guards, usage of weapons, fire safety, electric device usage and so on. If carefully adhered to, strict regulations will prevent crimes and accidents like stealing, fighting, fires and electric shocks. \\u2028Second, strict rules provide a wonderful atmosphere among residents. Students are asked to respect all residents' privacy and maintain a quiet atmosphere for study and adequate sleep. Once mutual respect has been built, residents are likely to enjoy their time in the community and develop an intimate relationship with one another.",

  "answer": "One of the greatest challenges in life can be figuring out what one wants and then having the courage to pursue it. I found this out when attempting to overcome my lifelong fear of water and swimming. Here is how I, with the help of my father, managed this. First, my father taught me to put things into perspective. He told me that I needn’t be embarrassed of my fear, because everyone has a different level of water confidence, and that one’s level of water confidence can change depending on circumstances. Even experienced swimmers, he said, can sometimes experience a fear of water or at least a certain level of anxiety. This put my mind at ease. Second, he instructed me to address my fear of water by doing a few basic exercises in shallow water first and building my way up. He said there was no need for the water to go higher than my chest, so I always felt safe. Then he taught me to steadily acclimatize — I first submerged my head, then blew a few bubbles and then went further. By the end of that summer, I had conquered my fear of water. I found that doing exercises in a swimming pool with clean water is best because you can see what is in the water. This made me less anxious. But the main lesson I learned was the importance of having a supportive person at your side. If it weren’t for my loving father, I would still be frightened of water today.  ",

My family probably has the largest collection of photographs on earth, ranging from the moment I was born to the past week. Something worthwhile enough to warrant taking a photo must be a special event, be it a family gathering or a trip to somewhere beautiful. The photos themselves may not be spectacular, but the moments they represent usually are. Every time I look through the photograph album, being reminded of these special moments really warms my heart.\\u2028The second reason is that I’m often better suited to old things than new ones.

Industrial waste today is the main source of all types of pollution, so the recycling of industrial products — such as cans, chemicals and plastics — helps to cut down pollution levels considerably.

Of course, studying art helps some students find a hidden ability and then enables them to develop their special talent. Beyond that, however, there are two main reasons why you should encourage your kids to draw and paint. The first is that art helps children discover the joy of creating. We live in an age of technology, where many kids spend large amounts of time in front of computers, televisions, or video games. Their tendency is to sit and watch. However, we were created to create, and today (especially!) young people need opportunities to stimulate their imaginations. The second reason is that when you teach your children to draw, you are helping to develop his or her self-esteem and self-confidence.

I've never hunted before, so learning how to effectively stalk, kill and butcher turkeys was a fascinating learning curve. \\u2028Second, the hunts are held on large areas of public land with a limited number of hunters allowed. This reduces the likelihood of disturbance from other hunters and provides an added measure of safety. This makes turkey hunting a personalized and relatively carefree hobby. ",

A painting with soft blue lines can soothe us, or music with a strong beat can make us feel energetic. Not only that, but we also **attach memories to** these things. We'll remember the song we listened to on our first date, for instance. These deep emotions offer us a sense of purpose and worth. Artists are also important because they reflect the society we live in. Every culture has its own art and music, each unique and appreciated in different ways. The type of art and music a culture produces can tell us all we need to know about them. Artwork from the **renaissance period**, for instance, showed society as it changed from simply existing, to progressing.  Protest songs from the 60s reflect the attitudes that many held toward the war and current events of the day.  In our times, with **mass media** giving us so much exposure, art continues to change society. It can change the way people view an issue, and it can push ideas forward faster than anything else. ***Notes：**1.

An ill prepared student is likely to fail, and the only thing they’ll have to show for their wasted time is the debt they accrued during their time at university. \\u2028Closely related to the preparedness problem is the growing presence of underqualified international students at Canadian universities. Increasingly, universities across the country are seeking to attract as many international students as they can, largely because they have suffered year after year of cuts and are desperate for revenue. This is problematic for both existing native students and the underqualified international students themselves. \\u2028Another challenge is the expectation for universities to adapt to changes in student expectations. This has the matter backwards. The real issue with regards to expectations is getting students to understand what our expectations are of them, not to conform to their expectations of us.",

Try reframing risk-taking as an opportunity to succeed rather than a path to failure and you’ll see results.Second, it’s impossible to achieve our dreams when playing it safe.

We can see how different cultures and beliefs developed through history, and how they changed over the centuries. We can therefore acquire a broader and richer understanding of our world today.\\u2028It is often said that “those who do not learn from the past are doomed to repeat it.” Some of life’s most meaningful teachings come from those who have gone before us.

Students who are hungry in class always look at their watches, wishing time could go faster. In this sense, hunger can be a major distraction for students. \\u2028Also, if approached sensibly, food could actually be incorporated into lesson plans. For younger students, eating an apple sliced into four quarters might easily turn into a math lesson using fractions, a writing activity about the five senses, or a fun nutrition education activity. For senior students, that same apple might spark a scientific inquiry about energy, calories or even plant life cycles. The possibilities are endless and the benefits are countless.",

Especially for small business owners, the only way they can compete is by advertising their strengths and what sets them apart from the big dogs.\\u2028Successful advertisements designed by the inventors' delicate work are creative and ideological. They seem to have become an art form that can create brand awareness. For consumers, though many adverts adopt clichés and can be annoying — and some TV or movie commercials can be disturbing — we have to admit that advertisements help us choose the product we desire the most.

Let me remind you, an American football game lasts three hours. If you watched one fewer football game per week, you could do an intense weight training session, practice writing or even go to a coffee shop and talk to a girl.\\u2028Second, watching other men accomplish things is meaningless.

She was a poet and also the first woman to open a school for women.I think her best quality, however, was that she was a fighter. She was brave and she never gave up. She fought for women and strived to gain equal rights for them. She wanted women to study and go to school, just like their male counterparts. In those days, schooling was reserved for men. But Juana thought differently. She thought that women deserved the same rights and opportunities as men. This motivated her to keep studying and studying. But when she tried to get into college, they told her that it was just for men. So, she entered the college disguised as a man. When they discovered her, she was expelled.\\u2028Unlike others, she followed her own passions and rejected cultural norms, so she kept studying and did not marry. Around this time, she started writing poems about the malevolence of the patriarchy. My favorite of her poems is “Hombres Necios,” meaning “Ignorant Men.” It talks about what men let women do and what they don't. I think it is a great poem because it says a lot of true things about men, women and life. The society she lived in was against her beliefs and tried to prevent her poems from being published.

Consider the sci-fi scientist who built the time machine. He must have been a genius to do so. But then he tries it out with no backup plan at all, just because he's so passionate that he doesn't have time to think about it! This is inconceivable and tedious.",

  "title": "Which of the following jobs or careers do you think would be the most rewarding: teacher, scientist or journalist? Explain your answer. ",
  "answer": "No “rewarding career” list would be complete without teaching being near the top. I feel this way for the following reasons. \\u2028First, from preschool to high school, teachers help to mold young minds by educating them about math, science, language and the arts. Studies show that over two thirds of teachers are satisfied with their jobs. After all, who among us of any age can't still rattle off the name of their favorite teacher at school? \\u2028Second, it's an immensely powerful post, as teachers assume the role of both educator and role model simultaneously — most of us wish they were paid more substantially for this. Teachers shape the future and give students somebody to look up to. What could be more rewarding than this? ",

  "answer": "For some people, spending a birthday quietly is a depressing and sad thought, but I find it refreshing. I feel this way for the following reasons.\\u2028First, in my opinion, birthdays are opportunities to improve one’s mind, body and soul. Especially when living a very busy lifestyle, this type of birthday can offer much needed respite. Rather than wasting the time partying, birthdays should be used to contemplate one’s life or year, make some changes, set new goals and quietly celebrate achievements. \\u2028Second, on birthdays I strive to avoid stress at all costs, so I can do whatever I want without worrying about the chores of daily life. Though I enjoy socializing, throwing a party can be a stressful endeavour. It’s better to kick back and relax. ",

  "title": "Your friend has decided to quit college. Do you support their decision?",
  "answer": "I would persuade them to rethink their decision. The reasons for this are as follows. First, people with college degrees make more money than those who just have high school diplomas. According to a survey, people with a college degree make around $1,100 a week. Someone with a high school diploma makes just $638. The financial rewards of completing a degree should be a pull factor. Second, earning a degree makes you more empowered as an agent in your own life. Through becoming better educated about the things that have an impact on your day-to-day existence, such as knowing how to read a lease, having an understanding of how markets influence your retirement accounts and handling the finances of your family, you will be better prepared to face the big bad world. A college education can empower you in all kinds of ways to be more in control of your life's logistics.",

  "title": "If given an empty piece of land, would you rather use it to build a garden or a playground for children?",
  "answer": "Compared to building a playground for children, growing a garden in empty land has many more advantages.\\u2028Improving your health is one good reason to grow a garden. Eating fruits and vegetables is a proven way to stay healthy. Many studies have found that people who eat more fruits and vegetables suffer less from cancer and chronic diseases. It’s a lot easier to get more vegetables into your diet when they are growing affordably right in your backyard!\\u2028Besides, this isn’t the only heath benefit gardening offers. It’s also an easy and enjoyable way to spend time in the fresh air and sunshine, getting healthy, moderate exercise. Most people agree that gardening is pleasant and relaxing, and it has actually been clinically proven to alleviate stress.",

  "title": "What do you think we should do to reduce the use of cars and other vehicles in order solve traffic problems?",
  "answer": "In my opinion, the best way to reduce the use of cars and other vehicles is to improve our public transportation system so that people can use public transit more frequently.\\u2028For example, in Taiwan only the biggest two cities have subway systems. In all other cities people have to drive a car or ride a scooter in their daily commute. This makes traffic in most places crowded and dangerous, especially during rush hours.\\u2028Besides subways, we need more buses connecting suburbs with longer routes so that people in the outskirts can take the bus to work rather than drive everywhere. Therefore, promoting and enhancing public transportation systems would greatly reduce the traffic during rush hours and solve our traffic problems.",

  "answer": "Although it costs lots of money and time to build a good collection, I still can't help collecting old things.\\u2028First, it can be a real source of satisfaction for me to complete an old collection. Knowing that I own very rare items not only makes me feel proud of myself, but also grants me bragging rights with my friends and family.\\u2028Second, it is an investment and I hope that my collection will rise in value over the years. This is not easy and, if I'm not careful, I will lose more money than I can make. In cases like these, it is important to gain expertise in the field and use guides to get an idea of how much old items are worth.",

  "answer": "Doing volunteer work is really a great thing to do. \\u2028The first reason is that most students have a lot of fun volunteering. They enjoy the people they work with, get a chance to do things that they like, and achieve a sense of satisfaction from their volunteer activities.\\u2028Second, one of the most powerful things that young people get from volunteering is the knowledge that they have made a difference in someone’s life. Many of the students are deeply affected by the positive feeling this gives them. As a result of volunteering, many of the students gain a new sense of appreciation for what they have and a better understanding of what life is like for people who may not have very much.",

  "answer": "I prefer to have more free time. Here’s why. \\u2028First, relaxation promotes the development of new ideas and lets creativity flow. The world is moving at a breakneck speed; information is overflowing 24 hours a day. If your mind is constantly bombarded with new information, voices and sounds, then it will be very hard to find room for creativity and for getting new ideas.\\u2028Second, slow down and enjoy life. It’s not only the scenery you miss by going too fast — you also miss the sense of where you are going and why. Through having more free time you can gain clarity and find out what is most important to you. I would thoroughly recommend slowing down and freeing up some space in your mind.",
